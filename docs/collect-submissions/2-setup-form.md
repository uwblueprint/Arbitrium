## Set up your form

### Name your form

Replace "Untitled Form" at the top of the page with your form's title. This is what applicants will see on the first page when applying for your opportunity.

### Add a form description

Under your form title, you can add an optional form description. This is a great place to put information about your form like:

- A link to a copy of your questions
- Contact information
- Deadlines
- Anything else you think would help your applicants!

If your form is long, we'd highly advise that you ask applicants to prepare their responses and save them in a safe place, before proceeding to fill out the form. To support this, in the form description, you can include a link to a copy of the questions you'll create.

### Customize the Identifier question

Each Arbitrium form has a mandatory **Identifier** question. Your candidates' responses to this question will be used to identify them across the Arbitrium for your review committee.

You can customize this question for your form by changing the **Question Text** or **Question Description**.
