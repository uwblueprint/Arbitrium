## About form questions

Each form question represents a distinct piece of information you can collect to help inform your review committee. Each question lives within a section, which groups questions together for your applicants and committee members.

## The Identifier Question

The **Identifier Question** is a special mandatory question that is used to uniquely identify an applicant for your review committee.

You can configure what this means for your committee by changing the Identifier Question's text and description. Some example identifiers include:
* Organization name
* Contact person

<!-- ## Question types

2. Replace "Untitled" with the prompt for your applicants.
