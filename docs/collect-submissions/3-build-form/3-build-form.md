# Step 3: Build a form

## Things to keep in mind

Here's a few things you should know about the Arbitrium form builder:
- Any changes you make in the form builder are saved automatically. You can leave at any time and resume your work later.
- Program Admins can also help build your form. However, collaborative editing isn't supported at this time â€“ working on the form builder at the same time may risk losing your changes.
