## Test your form

Before you send your form out to candidates, it's a good idea to give it a test run to make sure everything looks and runs how you expect. Within the form builder, you can generate a Preview Link to you and your team to test as if you were a candidate.

Responses submitted to this link will not be recorded.

2. Open the link. You can:
   1. Copy the link to your clipboard by clicking the URL or **Copy Link**.
   2. Click **Open In New Tab**.
3. Test your form! You can edit things in the form builder and refresh the form to see your changes.

### Tips for testing forms

* **Look out for typos!** Verify that your form, sections, and questions titles and descriptions are correct.
* **Ensure consistency.** Cross-reference the questions and validations with your read-only copies.
* **Validate your validations.** Ensure your word limits and other validations are what candidates would expect.

## Publish it to the world!

When you're confident that your form's good to go, publish your form to get a link to share with your candidates.

Your form **cannot** be edited after you publish it! Please make sure you proof-read and test before publishing.
