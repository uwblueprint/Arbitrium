# Step 1: Create a program

Setting up a new decision process starts with creating a program. An Arbitrium program holds your application form, submissions, and reviews made by your committee.

Every program has one form, which allow you to collect the information from applicants that your team needs to make the most informed decision possible. The form builder helps you design and visualize what applicants will fill out when submitting their application to your workflow.

## Create a new program

Only Organization Admins can create new programs for your organization. By default, all Organization Admins are granted Program Admin access to new programs. You can always change a user's role, or remove them if they shouldn't be there.

1. On the **All Programs** page, begin by clicking **Add new**.
2. Enter a name for your program.
   - This will help you, your admins, and committee members identify the program within Arbitrium.
   - Applicants cannot see the program name.
   - You can always change this later!
3. Click **Create**.
4. Your new program should show in the **Programs** table. Click **View** to enter your program's workspace.
5. In the top right corner, click the down arrow icon to expand the different pages of your workspace.
6. Select **Form Management** to open your program's form builder.
