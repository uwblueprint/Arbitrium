4/7/2020 9:08:29,Women's Crisis Services of Waterloo Region,106716525RR001,"Jennifer Hutton, CEO",jennifer.hutton@wcswr.org,,,"700 Heritage Drive Kitchener, ON ",https://wcswr.org,"Our urgent need is to be able to provide safe shelter for women and children experiencing domestic violence. We know that if we did not have shelter space available for these families their safety could be at grave risk. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen reports of increased rates of domestic violence globally. We anticipate that in the coming weeks we will see an increased demand/need for our services. This is because research shows during times of stress, economic downturn and natural disasters violence is likely to escalate.  Further, with self-isolation being imposed, women do not have reprieve from abusive situations. The population that we serve is extremely vulnerable due to histories of trauma, current and past addictions, as well as mental health struggles. We support women of all ages including seniors. Some of the children we serve have disabilities whether developmental, physical and/or cognitive. Both of these groups are additionally vulnerable because of compromised immune systems due to health concerns as a result of years of trauma. 

In order to provide shelter for those who need it most, we must have willing and well staff. During this difficult time our staff have been rising to the occasion, however, they are also very stressed and worried. Even with best efforts and intentions, communal living can increase exposure for staff and residents. We have taken increased precautions to protect staff and residents, however, these added duties can make supporting clients even more challenging for staff. While we are continuing to support vulnerable women and children in our community, we are also doing our best to protect the physical and mental well-being of our staff during this challenging time.
","$20,000","At Women’s Crisis Services, there are several new activities taking place in shelter for staff and residents in light of COVID-19. While many of these initiatives are new, other regular activities have also been enhanced to ensure effective service delivery.

Currently, residents are spending more time in their rooms to maintain social distancing. With children off school and so many residents indoors, we needed to put measures in place to ensure everyone’s safety to the best of our abilities as well as ensuring there was things to do to occupy their time. 

Core activities for residents:
•	Senior leadership is spending time meeting directly and communicating with residents 
•	Wellness activity boxes (filled with craft and art supplies) have been created to help 
        residents de-stress and occupy their time
•	We have set up isolation rooms
•	We purchased a Netflix subscription and smart DVD player to enhance entertainment 
        options
•	Enhanced WI-FI in shelter
•	Meal delivery for residents in isolation
•	Purchasing of PPE (masks, gloves) for residents 
•	Enhanced cleaning and sanitization by both staff and contracted cleaning company
•	Increased use of taxi/car service to decrease exposure on public transit 
•	Increased staffing levels to support residents

The other key area where we are focusing our efforts is staff safety and well-being. During these difficult times, we are doing everything we can to support our staff members.

Core activities for staff:
•	Purchased Zoom to enable staff and resident video calling
•	Implemented Zoom meetings between staff and leadership (initially daily, then bi- 
        weekly and now weekly)
•	Providing weekly staff lunches following meetings
•	Introduced COVID-19 champion pay incentive (time limited $2.00 per hour incentive for 
        those working in shelter)
•	Implementing “COVID days” to protect staff’s sick bank from getting used up too quickly
•	Staff self-care/wellness room with snacks and activities to support staff mental health
•	Wellness task force launched by HR Manager in conjunction with staff team
•	Training for proper PPE usage 
•	Exploring online auction platform due to cancelled fundraising event
•	Purchasing PPE (masks, gloves) for staff

We anticipated that some of our COVID-19 related costs such as the Pay Incentive Program would be covered under the Federal Wage Subsidy, however, it does not look like we will qualify. In order to qualify, revenue from donations must be down by 30%. In March, we had to cancel our “Hats Off to Mom!” Mother’s Day Brunch, though we still received some funds through donated sponsorship. That being said, we will only make about 40% of what we would have made if we could have held the event.  It is unlikely that we will receive this subsidy in April, however, it is possible we might receive it in May. We do worry more about the months following May as that is likely the time when we will really see the impact of lost fundraising revenue.
","There has been a significant impact on our staff who are working on the ‘front-lines’ during the COVID-19 pandemic as they are putting themselves at risk. We require well staff to be able to best serve the women and children who need us. We have approached COVID-19 by encouraging all staff to work together as one team.  Our community and admin staff have been helping with sanitization and supporting residential staff to ensure they are doing their part to help keep the shelter safe and the women and children supported. 

To acknowledge staff for their hard work and the risks that they are taking we have launched a COVID-19 Champion Pay Incentive Program. Through this program, all staff currently working in the shelters will receive an additional $2.00 / hour retroactive to March 15th 2020, which is costing the agency just over $18,600.  As previously indicated, it is unlikely that we will quality for the Federal Wage Subsidy.  We will also be launching COVID sick days as many staff have exhausted their sick bank entitlements early in the year. Each staff member will receive five COVID days for illness or mandated time off due to travel prior to COVID worsening. This will come at an additional cost for the agency. 

To protect staff and residents, we have needed to purchase Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as masks, gloves and a scan thermometer to assist with screening.  Our costs for PPE and additional cleaning supplies is already close to $2,000. We have purchased additional cleaning hours by the contracted cleaning company that we use. We have almost doubled our cleaning and sanitization costs. This cost us an additional $1,500 in the month of March when this only occurred in the second half of the month. This is all necessary but comes at a significant cost.

We rely on fundraising to cover almost 30% of our operating costs. We are seeing decreased donations due to the economy as well as cancelled third party events. As an organization we receive much of our fundraising through community members hosting third party events for us. As mentioned earlier, we also had to cancel one of our major annual fundraising events. Unfortunately, donation revenue is down at a time when our costs are going up. 
","Women’s Crisis Services Board of Directors and Leadership team have been discussing the impact of COVID-19 and we are planning for the future. We are fortunate that we have a small amount of reserves should we require this. We have been brainstorming and getting creative around different ways that we can fundraise such as having virtual auction events. 
We are also looking at ways to decrease our costs. For example, we currently have a staff off on unpaid leave and have deployed other staff to cover, thus helping lessen costs where possible. We have unfortunately also had to look at where we could lay off staff if that becomes necessary.

We have been working with other Cambridge shelters and Langs to do COVID- 19 planning around how we can continue to best serve our vulnerable populations. This has included looking at the ways in which we can share our resources and help one another during this challenging time.  We are a partner of the Family Violence Project and will be having further discussions with that group around how we can look ahead and prepare for the likely increased demand for service. 

We also are the lead agency of a group of rural Violence Against Women agencies such as Wilmot Family Resource Centre, Woolwich Counselling Centre, Interfaith, Woolwich Community Services, and Family Counselling Centre of Cambridgeand North Dumfries.  Through this group of agencies we maintain a fund for emergent issues that rural women may face such as having to relocate for safety or needing help with farm animals.

Also, Violence against Women shelters in the province have virtual weekly meetings to discuss our challenges, how we can support each other and share resources and strategies.

Simply put, the aim of this organization is to help people with disabilities live independent lives. Although we offer many programs, the focus of this application is on Attendant Services.
Attendant Service is the consumer-directed physical assistance with personal care which a person with physical disabilities cannot perform because of the limitations or impairments resulting from a permanent physical disability. At present, we provide daily support to more than 230 people in Waterloo Region.
During this pandemic it is necessary for staff to take additional precautions and while we began preparing for this in late January, supplies are dwindling and cost to replenish has increased greatly. In order to safely support the people we serve; people labelled as the vulnerable sector, those with compromised immune systems, it is becoming increasingly difficult to do this safely. 
As research confirms that there are both pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers, our practice went from using PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) when necessary to it being necessary all of the time.  Therefore, although we were well stocked before the pandemic hit the region, we now find ourselves with dwindling supplies. 
The needs are changing every day and so are directives from the LHIN. We were as prepared as we could be but this pandemic is evolving and we are working hard to keep up. 
","$20,000","Our Personal Support Workers (PSW) and attendants working on the frontline during this COVID-19 pandemic are working tirelessly to provide daily supports to people with disabilities all over Waterloo Region. That includes activities such as getting out of bed and bathing. We also help with the preparing of food, eating and much more. The tasks our staff help with require close contact. While we follow instructions from the LHIN to keep both consumers and staff safe, we are at risk of running out of PPE. We need funds to purchase additional masks, gloves, gowns and hand sanitizer. ","We seek funds to purchase more PPE.  (specifically: masks, gloves, gowns and hand sanitizer). 100% of funds received would be used for this. More PPE would protect the physical and mental health of our staff and consumers. As you can imagine, our frontline staff and the consumers we support are becoming increasingly anxious about the COVID-19 state and our ability to protect them while we do this essential work","Our funding is secure for normal operations. The attendant service department is funded by the WWLHIN and therefore viability is not a concern for ILCWR. Our team is working hard to put plans in place to ensure we have adequate staff, that staff and consumer are supported, that we have the ability to modify service delivery if necessary and so on. The only concern we have at present is the diminishing PPE supplies. ","Here is a link to our accountability page of our website.

This includes twice daily screening of all individuals staying at The Bridges, and using our Voluntary Trustee Program.   This is a particular challenge with individuals with significant mental health issues who barely understand what a virus is, let alone that it could be fatal and that they need to keep themselves removed from others in order to remain safe.  We have also purchased extra disinfecting products and personal protective equipment to keep staff and residents safe and healthy.  We have begun to use compostable plates, bowls and cups to ensure that kitchen and cleaning staff have no contact with any bodily fluids of residents.
We have also worked with our IT providers to have three staff persons work from home to keep them safe.  These staff have health issues that make them more susceptible to Covid 19 complications.","$20,000","We are asking for support in purchasing the extra supplies; PPE, cleaning supplies and kitchen supplies.  These are necessary to keep the building in a clean and sterile condition and to ensure that no staff person or volunteer comes in contact with any bodily fluids that might be transferred on china plates, cups and bowls.  Our building is 20,000 square feet, including dormitory, drop-in/eating space and 20 bachelor apartments.  The entire facility is cleaned and disinfected several times a day.
We have incurred IT costs to have three staff with health issues work from home.  This includes the remote hook-up and downloading necessary programming on to their laptops.
We have also hired a peer/monitor/screening person.  This staff person connects with residents to help them understand the need for compliance to Public Health standards, leads the twice daily screening of all residents; three times weekly screens all of the participants of our Voluntary Trust Program and supervises and screens residents that we have in the Super 8 motel.
As a peer, this staff person has a much better ability to direct residents with mental health issues and have them follow through with regular hand washing and physical distancing.  It is a significant challenge to keep this diverse population safe and healthy.
This staff person has been hired on a 16-week contract.
This has freed up our other staff to continue programming, and oversight of the shelter and drop-in.  Because of the physical distancing requirement, we have individuals sleeping both on the first floor and the third floor, which requires double staffing.
We are able to take advantage of the federal wage subsidy program of up to $1,375 for eligible employees.","All of the activities support the health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers.  While some of our over 400 volunteers have chosen to take a break, many are still participating in dinner preparations each night.  We supply gloves, masks and hand sanitizer to all staff and volunteers, and have begun using compostable plates, cups and bowls to prevent any possible transfer of bodily fluids.
We have accommodated three staff with compromised health issues to work from home, so that we do not put them in any unnecessary danger.
We have hired a peer/monitor/screening person to reduce stress on our already maxed out shelter and drop-in staff and to assist with the regular and ongoing screening processes that we have in place.","We have continued an online presence to solicit donations of both cash and gifts-in-kind.  We have a newsletter coming out this week.  Since 65% of our funding comes from the Region of Waterloo, that funding is secure.  Our Board is reaching out to their networks for their support and we are making application to a number of granting foundations for support.  Before this outbreak, we had streamlined our staffing numbers and programming, and this has served us well to keep costs in check.","United Way Covid Fund

People with disabilities are at extreme risk and require additional support to ensure their health and safety at this time. According to the World Health Organization report “Disability Considerations During the COVID-19 outbreak” (March 26, 2020) some people with disabilities are vulnerable to COVID-19 because of existing health conditions, barriers in accessing health services and difficulty enacting social distancing if they rely on others for support. Many others are at risk because of the measures put in place in response to COVID-19 which have resulted in financial burden as they struggle to pay for supplies that are required to maintain well-being during an extended period of isolation. 
Assistive Devices are one such investment that, while critical component to someone’s mobility and functional independence, are very expensive and when people live in poverty, they often find themselves sacrificing basic life necessities like food, shelter, clothing and essential medical items. Without these supports in place, individuals with disabilities can find themselves at higher risk for falls, injuries and hospitalization.  
Unfortunately, available funding for these devices is limited. In fact, there has been a substantial increase in the number of applicants turned away through March of Dimes Canada’s Assistive Devices Program due to lack of funding. In 2018-2019, 28 people requesting $37,139 worth of equipment were turned away. Last year, that rose to 41 people seeking a staggering $155,573. Demand for Assistive Devices funding will only continue to increase due to COVID-19. Keeping vulnerable persons safe at home rather than in hospitals is as essential to their personal health as it is to public health.  

","$20,000","The main activities of the Program are to coordinate the purchase and delivery of assistive devices. The Assistive Devices Counsellor, who is specifically assigned to Waterloo Region Communities, works closely with community stakeholders including vendors, occupational therapists, social service agencies and other funding resources. That person works with applicants, their health care providers, and local vendors to ensure that they receive the assistive devices they require. 

In order to try to bridge the service gap mentioned above, MODC is seeking $20,000 to spend directly on assistive devices for adults and seniors with disabilities who need assistance in your community.  

The need continues to grow. Today, one in seven people (15%) are living with a disability in Ontario and more than 40% are over age 65. According to the report, To Prosperity: Poverty Reduction Strategy 30% of people with disabilities live in poverty. With a population of 535,154 (2016 census), there are over 24,000 people in Waterloo Region with a disability and who are living in poverty. These statistics will only continue to increase as the population ages.  

In fact, the largest groups of applicants to this program have incomes under $20,000 per year. The MODC Assistive Devices Program funds those who are living in poverty and have no other means to purchase basic and essential assistive devices. During 2019-2020, the Assistive Devices Program served 57 applicants and provided 129 number of devices for a total retail value of $111,530. Of those applicants, 35 (61%) served were over the age of 65.   
Essential assistive devices contribute towards an individual and their family's health, safety, quality of life and community participation. MODC knows that providing someone with an assistive device can help them safely access their community for essentials (e.g. shopping for groceries) and reduce caregiver burden. Assistive devices also enable seniors to stay longer in their own homes in a safe, affordable and secure environment. Strengthening the individual's capacity for independence contributes positively to their safety – and the safety of others – not only during this pandemic, but long-term as well.
","Our funding request would solely be spent on assistive devices to directly support the needs of adults and seniors with disabilities in Waterloo Region Communities.  For the Program to achieve its goals, it relies heavily on collaboration and the support of the community to secure funding for consumers’ devices.  Counsellors advocate for consumers who may be eligible for government assistance or insurance and seek funding partnerships or collaboration with other agencies and disability-related organizations.  

This grant would be used as “seed” money and provide leverage in negotiating cost-sharing options with other agencies to ensure that equipment can be purchased to meet the needs of those living on low incomes.  Funders are more inclined to help sponsor the cost of an assistive device if they know that other funding is being contributed.  

Often, MODC staff work to coordinate 3 or 4 funding sources, using the grant money to establish that some of the cost is being covered. The dollars provided by Waterloo Region Communities are strictly used to assist persons living in Waterloo Region Communities with the purchase or repair of their assistive device(s). Therefore, a $20,000 donation utilizing the full amount for direct consumer service and nothing for service delivery will allow us to serve 44 individuals with the purchase and repair of 88 assistive devices. Our aim would be to purchase $90,000 worth of equipment with the funding provided from this grant.  As this would be in addition to our existing program in Waterloo Region Communities, it would bring the total number of consumers served to 72 with the provision of 144 devices.   
","March of Dimes Canada is committed to the health and safety of all our stakeholders – people with disabilities who participate in our programs and services; our dedicated employees and volunteers; and our generous supporters from coast to coast.  
We are closely monitoring developments related to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) and taking appropriate action so that we can continue safely providing the support our community counts on. Our response plan is informed by the latest information and guidance from the Public Health Agency of Canada, other relevant authorities and our funding partners. 
We are absolutely committed to continuing to support Canadians with disabilities through this challenging time. To do that, we’re making some changes to put health and safety first and find new ways to connect to and serve our community. 
 
Our offices are closed to the public, except for people with scheduled appointments. All office visitors are being pre-screened. We are continuing to provide Community Support Services, such as attendant care. Our Employment Services also continue to operate, with services being delivered by phone or virtually wherever possible, with a small number of necessary in-person appointments continuing to be held in our offices. We are following public health authority protocols when we are working directly with clients in order to ensure health and safety for all involved. We are converting the majority of our in-person Community Engagement and Integration Services sessions to be conducted over the telephone or online and new programs are being added regularly. We are postponing all fundraising events originally scheduled to occur up to the end of June. Across all our business areas, we've rolled out a range of tools and information, including screening protocols, to support enhanced health and safety practices and minimize the risk of COVID-19.

Indigenous people make up 50% of our homeless population as determined by healthcare. Indigenous people often have secondary illnesses which makes them much more vulnerable to Covid-19. There is a huge mistrust of government, healthcares and colonial systems. There are a number of Indigenous people and families in extreme need even before the added impacts of Covid 19. For those with intergenerational trauma, there is a propensity for increased acts of violence and abuse, addictions and mental health issues. For those in need, they make up our lowest income earners and may not even be eligible to government subsidies because they don’t meet the criteria. 
The loss of funding and work will create incredible problems for Indigenous people in need. 
Potential challenges and risks: 
-	May not be able to provide or afford diapers, food or medication
-	Affordability of their shelter 
-	Inability to support at home education for their children while schools are closed 
-	At an increased risk for domestic violence.
-	Lack of transportation to access essential services
We believe this is our region’s most vulnerable population and the population most in need of help. It is also a group that may not even ask for or trust help from government organizations. The Indigenous people in need could include single parents with children, families and family groups which may include extended family members. We need an Indigenous led solution to help reduce the impact of this crisis. The program we are proposing is an opportunity to make a significant difference for Indigenous people in need who live in the region. 
To help families in need cope both mentally and financially during this time of crisis we need to create and deliver Covid support packages that contain essential items. 
","$20,000","Indigenous Community Support Program

This program is designed to help mitigate the financial, emotional and social impacts on Indigenous community members adversely impacted by Covid-19. Before we were forced to close our doors due to Covid-19, we provided a number of supports to Indigenous community members that were in addition to our core programs (EarlyON and Employment). Specifically, we provided food, clothing, winter wear, diapers, formula, books, toys, birthday and Christmas gifts and many additional Indigenous specific resources through our website. We also plan to launch a bicycle lending program this spring. This new program will be an extension and enhancement of activities we already deliver. Families in our community depend on our centre for these items.

We will work with community partners to identify families in need of this support. We will consult with each family to determine their specific needs. Based on experience, we anticipate families needing some food, diapers, formula and activities to engage children. They may also need outdoor items like bicycles, balls, etc. These indoor and outdoor engagement items will be absolutely essential to support families and children from a mental health perspective as they deal with the stress associated with Covid-19 and resulting social isolation. Many at risk or in need families may already be dealing with significant reconciliation-based trauma. Covid-19 and social isolation may be one stress too many. Plainly put, our proposed program will help reduce stress which will in turn create a better ability to cope. 

We will reach out to our community to collect as many donations as possible for non-perishables like clothing, toys, and books. We will connect with community partners like the Food Bank to get staples and necessary items and to utilize their infrastructure and processes. We will reach out to our previous corporate donors (Pampers, Johnson and Johnson, Knights of Columbus) and churches to secure additional items. We will utilize donations and partnerships wherever possible in order to maximize the impact of this program. The money requested will be used to purchase items we are not able to secure through donations and to run the program.

Our staff will create custom care packages for each Indigenous family. We plan to distribute these packages on a biweekly basis for the next three months or until we reopen our doors to the public (which ever comes first). We anticipate this to be the social isolation period. With multiple barriers and inability to physically connect with communities, it is important that families can manage their own mental health to the best of their abilities. 

We believe this program to be essential to the wellbeing of Indigenous people of the region and supports Indigenous focused crisis management. Through this program, we hope to help at least 200 at-risk and in need families. We will augment the Covid-19 Community Response funding by utilizing community donations. This means the impact or benefit will be many times the initial investment.
","We plan to dedicate up to 5% of the funding for health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers. 
This enhanced service will come at considerable increased risk through interpersonal interactions since we will be delivering essential items to families in need, going to stores to purchase some essential items, and we will also be accepting donations from our social network to help support families (e.g., toys, books clothes). To lessen this increased risk, we will need disinfectants, cleansers and personal protective gear in order to accept, clean and distribute the care packages to Indigenous families in need. 
","Our two main businesses (EarlyON and Employment & Training) are in the process of converting to virtual online entities in order to provide similar and value added services but over the phone and internet. Given the extreme numbers of people who have lost their jobs and income, we expect to help many people find temporary employment with essential services. We are enhancing our website and social media to become a resource for families and people in need. By migrating to virtual online service, we are hoping to continue being funded by our three main government funders even though our doors are closed to the public. Currently, our biggest funder is supporting this approach on a monthly basis. Other planned services that we were in the process of building have been put on hold until full funding is obtained or the pandemic subsides. 
To offset upcoming costs of our not for profit, we are exploring options to capitalize on the dramatic decline in interest rates which will enhance our longer term viability. In the spirit of community, we have also offered our space (7000 sf) to the LHIN if they need temporary ward space for Covid 19 patients. We continue to promote and operationalize our social venture (a window washing company) to raise funds for our charity (profits are donated to the charity).

4/7/2020 16:25:51,Sunbeam Centre,108050899RR0001,Brian Swainson,b.swainson@sunbeamcentre.com,Susan Stark,s.stark@sunbeamcentre.com,2749 Kingsway Drive,https://www.sunbeamcentre.com/,"Sunbeam has 17 residential  care homes in Waterloo Region that are home to 91 people aged 6 to 81, living with Autism, physical, medical or cognitive challenges or a combination. They are all vulnerable in some manner but two of our residences are home to clients that are medically fragile. Three of these residents are seniors. 

Two weeks ago two of these sites were ordered to operate under full PPE / outbreak status by Waterloo Region Public Health due to COVID-19 swab testing. A third home was added last week although the order for that home has since been removed. 

Whenever we receive that type of order our direct support workers require additional personal protective equipment for their entire shift such as gowns, N95 masks and gloves. Residents are also required to wear masks if possible. These items do not last the entire eight to 12 hours so must be changed out throughout the shift.

The quantity of equipment that we have used in the past four weeks is far beyond what we would use in a year under normal conditions.","$15,000","For over 60 years our reason for existing has been to ensure the safety, health, & well being of our residents and those that serve them. 

Over the past month we have realized a significant increase in demand for Personal Protective Equipment given the increased safety measures & protocols that must be observed during this critical time.  The cost of gowns, masks, & gloves than we have already ordered exceeds $15,000 and we anticipate this to rise. Sadly we are purchasing at an increased cost but these items are critical to the safety of our staff and residents in all of our homes. Our current budget does not allow for this type of expenditure. 

Many of our residents, although not as medically fragile as our two homes on site at Kingsway Drive, still have significant health concerns that would place them in a high risk category. We must take all precautiouns to ensure their health and safety.

At this time we are only requesting the cost recovery of the PPE purchased to date to help us continue to fund new purchases, given we do not know the timeline of this virus.","We are seeking financial support for the additional personal protective equipment that is mandated by the order of Waterloo Region Public Health. 

We have also introduced additional safety measure at all of our residential care homes to ensure the health of both residents and care workers. This includes, but is not limited to, wearing gloves to handle food that will be consumed by others, wearing a mask when appropriate, and encouraging as much social distancing that is possible in close quarters. 

As you can imagine at times this is difficult given our residents might not understand why they are being asked to do this, and we must be cautious how much information we share with them. Their sense of security is critical to their well being.","Sunbeam has a pandemic protocal in place that is reviewed annually. What we are facing with COVID 19 is unlike anything anyone organization could have prepared for 100%.  The board & staff continue to move forward using all necessary precautions at this time to ensure the safety and well being of our clients, and the health and safety of our direct support workers.

Most non essential staff (those that do not directly provide support to residents) when possible are working from home to minimize interactions at our offices. Our Developmental Services Resource Team continues to take all the necessary precautions as they go into grocery stores to make sure that our homebound people are safe and well fed as they deliver food to our residential homes. 

Vacations have been cancelled to ensure workers that are ill can safely take the time away. This also ensures we have the adequate number of staff in our homes at all times. That said we realize that some staff might require a few days to de-stress so we are setting up protocols to make sure that happens.

We sit at round tables in Waterloo Region with FACS and other agencies that serve those at risk or vulnerable locally to ensure we are sharing best practices, identifying safe housing strategies for transitional aged youth and how we protect them during this time. We are responsible for finding housing for those with exceptional challenges & needs.

Our Executive Director stood in a line today to obtain much needed surgical masks for our front line workers as well as fabric to make cloth masks. Everyone in the organization pitches in to do what must be done in order for Sunbeam to continue its work of protecting our residents and staff.",
