We listen, facilitate healing, and celebrate resiliency. Using an intersectional feminist approach, we work to transform systems which promote gender-based violence. Vision: A world without sexual violence and oppression. ","We’re there when someone has experienced the darkest time in their life.
In the post-#MeToo era, we’ve been flooded with calls for support. 
Jian Ghomeshi. Bill Cosby. Harvey Weinstein. Sexual violence in the armed forces. In the RCMP. On college campuses. Concerns over police responses to sexual assaults. Headline after headline. And with each, more survivors reached out. 
We’re on the frontlines of this cultural shift locally. Five years ago, 40 survivors on our waiting list for counselling would have been a crisis; now we have 140. It’s our new normal.
As a Sexual Assault Support Centre, we wrap survivors in community care. We walk beside them on their journey. Our support is free and doesn’t come with time limits. For thirty years our motto’s been “You are NOT alone.” In the post-#MeToo era, we need your help to say this with confidence to survivors. 
We have a 24-Hour Support Line. We provide individual and group counselling. We accompany survivors to the police station, hospital, and court house. We offer practical supports. We also believe that public education can create social change and prevent violence in the future.
SVP is a philanthropic organization, but does so much more than providing funding. Members invest time and professional expertise in local non-profits, and seek to effect significant, long-term social change in our community. This is exactly what we’re trying to do as well.
We believe that if there ever was a time to invest in supports for survivors of sexual assault, and prevention work, it’s now… and especially in our community. Waterloo Region is currently in the midst of one of the largest sexual assault investigations in Canadian history – one neurologist has been charged with assaulting 63 women, and the investigation is still underway. 
","I believe trusted colleagues would describe me as passionate, authentic, collaborative, approachable, driven, and hard-working. Overall, I believe most folks who work with me trust my judgement, and believe in my ability and desire to make decisions in the best interests of our Centre and those we serve.

I strive to be an ambassador for SASC in Waterloo Region. My personal values and our Centre’s values align. I’ve been at our Centre in various capacities since 2002, which is rare in our sector. 

The two things I’m most proud of? We’ve doubled in size since I took over the newly created Executive Director role in 2015, including rolling out an incredible and very busy Anti-Human Trafficking Program. I'm also proud to have colleagues who are kind, passionate, and compassionate, and who care about survivors and work as team to achieve good things for our community.
","Our Board cares about survivors of sexual violence, supports our ED and staff team. Our Board members have values that align with the Centre.
We work to have a range of expertise and diversity on our Board complement. 
Our Board operates with transparency whenever possible, and is focused on governance, not operations.
A recent example of their strategic thinking? They supported our Executive Director in shifting half her direct reports to other managers so she could focus on the BIG PICTURE, and have the time to necessary to help move SASC to the next level in our community.
","Our ED and Board work on shared goals continuously. They drafted our 2017-2020 Strategic Plan in partnership. They developed various policies together to ensure the care and wellness of our team including: Preventing Vicarious Trauma & Burn Out Policy, RRSP matching policy, etc.
They work in partnership annually to secure sponsorships and auction items for our gala.
They work to connect our ED with their networks to secure support for the Centre. 
We’re moving into another collaborative Strategic Planning process in 2020, and welcome SVP to be part of it!
",We’re not expecting any major leadership changes within this timeframe. We’d be delighted to work with SVP over the next three years!,"Our Board President is generally replaced by the Vice-President, who has been groomed for the position in the previous year. We also have strong Governance Policies, that lay out processes clearly, which help with transition. That said, we are good at board retention, so we have a number of experienced members. 
On the operational side, our Executive Director works to ensure various processes are in place to assist with transition and communication, such as clear organizational/filing systems for funding information, key contacts, cross-training on key roles/information at the management level, etc. 
We don’t have a formal succession plan in place for our ED currently at the Board level; this is on our Centre’s to-do list. 
","In the post-#MeToo era, capacity is the overwhelming issue we face.
In 2018, we were set to get a sizeable increase in provincial funding to help meet this demand. After the provincial election, this funding was clawed back, creating more crisis in our sector.
In 2019, we successfully applied for funding from the Federal Government to hire our first-ever Communications & Development Coordinator (for four years). This grant covers 60% of a staff position.  Because of these funds, we’ve started to grow our fundraising program.
Our program includes, amongst other things, peer-to-peer fundraising opportunities, our annual gala, and a plan to secure and nurture monthly donors. Five years ago, SASC had three monthly donors. \to attract donors who can support services for survivors with sizeable gifts. 
","Project 1: Capacity and community engagement
Sexual violence has always been pervasive, but it hasn’t always been named and addressed. Now that society has experienced a cultural shift, we need SVP’s help to take our Centre to the next level… because survivors need us to grow. We need to develop strategies to engage folks to understand that if they support survivors, they need to support their community-based Sexual Assault Support Centre. 
We’re also facing all the other pressures that not-for-profit organizations are in this climate. In 2018, we were set to get a significant boast in our provincial funding to help meet the demand, but this funding was withdrawn after the election.
Overall, we need support to grow our fundraising program, and diversify our revenue sources. We have some ideas (such as an online social enterprise) that need to be researched, and developed if worthwhile. 
Project 2: Strategic Planning
We’re just completing our 2017-2020 Strategic Plan, and will be moving forward with creating a new one in 2020. We’d love SVP’s support with this process. We wrote our last plan before #MeToo.
Project 3: Office space/capital campaign/new home
We just received the news that the not-for-profit building we’ve occupied for 25 years is being sold. Our low rent has allowed us to flow our resources into programming. Staying here will mean coming up with an additional $60,000+ annually. We need help with a strategy. Do we stay put? Move? Consider a capital campaign? 
","We measure impact differently across our programs. In our Counselling Program, we ask survivors to complete feedback surveys. We also have pre- and post-tests that are optional for our clients to measure change in how they’re doing. We also use quantitative data like number of clients, number of counselling sessions, and number of participants in workshops.
In our Public Education Programs, we ask program participants to complete feedback surveys to communicate how much they learned, and how their attitudes shifted based on the workshop.
When we develop new programs, like our Anti-Human Trafficking Program, and our Workplace Sexual Harassment Program, we engage with external evaluators to ensure objective evaluation of our program development and impact.
And, in our sector, we also measure impact by simply listening to our clients. Our client’s testimonials are SO POWERFUL.  
","Our team has unique expertise and our model of service is effective. We provide a safe place. We walk beside survivors. We bear witness. We advocate. We understand the complex systems impacting survivors’ lives; we help navigate. We use an intersectional approach, which means we respect how survivor’s unique social locations impact their experiences, how people respond to them, and what resources they have access to. We celebrate the resiliency of survivors. We facilitate healing. We offer hope. 
Our approach to Public Education is known across the country. We were the first to develop a Male Allies Program to engage men and boys to be part of the work to end gendered violence. We developed anti-sexual violence curriculum for the OHL. We created Anti-Human Trafficking Curriculum that’s been adopted by a number of school boards, including the Waterloo Regional District School Board. ","We’ve been pretty transparent about our challenges and opportunities throughout this application. We have an amazing team at Centre and a healthy work environment. We try hard to care for our team as they do the challenging work on the frontlines with survivors of sexual violence every day. Our biggest challenge is truly that the resources needed for this work haven’t increased despite the incredible growth in demand. 
Last year, many people in our community were surprised to hear that Waterloo Region was rated the least safe major urban Centre in Canada for women. That study, by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said that our community’s combined rates of sexual assault, criminal harassment, and domestic violence were amongst the highest in Canada. To hear our Executive Director speak to this issue, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qym7HaW6Sc  
","We believe that if there ever was a time to invest in our work and in survivors of sexual violence, it’s now. 
If we’re selected to be SVP’s 2020 Investee, we’ll throw ourselves into the partnership! We’re a not-for-profit, but we’re also driven to succeed, to innovate, to grow, and to learn. Our inspiration comes from the incredible survivors we walk through our doors every day, and all the ones who sit on our waiting list. Let’s wrap them in community care.

Our mission, as a learning organization, is to support bottom-up knowledge creation rooted in lived experience, to mobilize all voices for community wide solutions; to support policy development and service systems navigation.  ","Our social development work recognizes that hard data collected over decades haven’t influenced investment in social assistance, affordable housing or healthcare. The missing ingredient is the respect of knowledge coming from lived experience of poverty, income insecurity and housing instability. Through dedicated community engagement, information management and bottom-up knowledge creation, we amplify the advocacy of lived experience groups and support strategic partnerships that ensure lasting social impact in Waterloo Region.","I am a qualified program developer, relationship builder, and an open-minded strategists who enjoys delegating work to invite synergy of diverse ideas and contributions. My colleagues appreciate me because of my dedication, professionalism, adaptability and capacity to tie information and ideas together, to tackle difficult questions, and to be patient bringing people on board with propositions that are new and seemingly impossible. ","The sudden loss of the Executive Director in 2018 called for a shift from the governance to the working board model. Board members pivoted through smooth transition and were extremely responsive to closer collaboration with the staff. They at first took a more authoritative approach towards relationship building with EDs in like-minded agencies, but were quickly able to assess the context in which up-and-coming ED would be better supported through a more successful process of forging lasting relationships through operational, mid-level management staff, working towards the top leadership.","With the development of the City of Kitchener Neighbourhood Strategy, the impact on the 26 years' old Festival of Neighbourhoods initiative, coordinated by the Social Development Centre, was becoming disruptive. Board members and the ED actively participated in a mediation process in 2018 & 2019 with the Festival partners (City of Kitchener & John MacDonald Architect) and have succeeded in redefining roles and scope for the continuation of collaboration. Long term strategy was developed where duplication and territoriality can be eliminated.   ","We do not foresee any major changes. The Board is planning to engage members with communications, legal, social investment and fundraising skills. As to the current Executive Director role, strategic development and organizational management skills could be strengthened, if more core funding allowed for a less intensive participation in direct project implementation, to scale up the operations and resources of existing projects. ","Currently, we have commitment of the Board members to stay on for a foreseeable future  and successively support new members taking on leadership roles. We are recruiting leaders of the the Civic Hub partner organizations  to strengthen the commitment, and we are seeking out members with business background, especially in social enterprise. Current ED expects to be able to employ a couple of professionals who have worked with us as pro bono associates, even members of the Board, already in tune with the mission of the organisation, who would complement current scaling up process, gain visibility as representatives of the Centre and ensure smooth transition into ED role. ","The Centre has gradually moved away from the expectations of public benefit dedicated funding towards multi year grants and building up the donor base. We will pursue grants that can offer decent compensation and the longevity of our programs, such as the Heritage Ministry Funding for the Civic Hub program. It allows us to run multiple projects with partners groups that feed into major initiatives, such as Wellbeing Waterloo Region or affordable housing advisory groups. Our donations from 2018 almost doubled in 2019.  Since 2018, we have succeeded in augmenting the number of staff to 5 by seeking funding through Ontario Job Creation Partnership. We hope that with this boost, we would be able to strengthen our strategic connections with universities, innovation hubs, and tech sector. ","The work of the Centre is becoming more visible and valued by a range of community partners, who seek collaboration and would be willing to invest specific projects, such as academic research partnerships, peer-based community engagement for municipal projects, data integration and service systems navigation tools. This work can be translated into direct investment into our programs such as the Civic Hub or Community Information and Mapping services. Potential project we would benefit from:

- marketing and communications, specifically in support of the Civic Hub program (being visible & recognized by players in tech, business, educational institutions. etc.)  
- social investment strategy, as our Civic Hub and Community Information programs have tangible value that can be monetized (brokering 'project based learning' with universities and colleges for students to have 'real life' community work required towards their degrees, or moving beyond production of directories, to development of service system online navigation tools/apps and maps)
- organizational capacity building - board, resources, and policy development to adjust to organization's growth (Board development,policies, social financing, shared platform, use of technology, etc.).
","We measure our impact of the community information services by the number of data shared,  level of accuracy of the data, persons served (OESP, Tax clinic, LEAP). Social development work is measured by the number of individuals supported, groups and organizations served, including municipalities and universities. The recognition of the lived experience groups we serve is measured by the number of consultations, forums and participatory research projects undertaken,  number of advisory groups they participate in. Through the roles SDC plays in strategic collaboratives, research projects and advisory committees. Civic Hub mobilization of groups and collaboration among them.The wellbeing & income security of the members of lived experience groups is an important measure too.","We take care the holistic wellbeing of the marginalized people we work with in a range of lived experience groups (provide meals, buss passes, honoraria for the work they do, de-stressing and conflict resolution skills building). We raise the value of the qualitative and oral history knowledge build by people directly impacted by inequities, marginalization and exclusion in the society. We translate this knowledge created by people with lived experience into advocacy, policy and consultation papers/research and support them in taking leadership roles in the community and in decision-making. We advocate for innovative and alternative solutions to current social challenges. ","Dedicated and passionate Board that needs guidance in skill development and succession planning. We have no fundraising experts or staff, or consistent communication supports. The trends indicate that social investment is the next frontier for non profits. We are dedicated to the principles of the living wage, decent work and benefits, and would strive to ensure it.  We are impacted by the closure of the Social Planning Council Cambridge and North Dumfries but we  would strive to ensure longevity of the community information  data management and social policy development.  We need more staff with technology and social enterprise background but our current staff is open to learn and create environment for growth. We are moving into podcast creation and production, production of radio programming, we are active on social media and could diversity our reach much further.","Supporting four advisory committees with the City of Kitchener on Neighbourhood Leadership, Event-in-a-Trailer, Affordable Housing and Mayor’s Task Force on Equity; co-facilitating the social inclusion groups with Wellbeing WR (Board members and staff sit on different committees); co-chairing WRDSB Equity and Inclusion Advisory Group; research partnerships with Planning at University of Waterloo and field supervision for student placements of the Faculty of Social Work at WLU.

Our vision is that every person lives with dignity as a valued member of the community.,"Parents for Community Living is a charitable not for profit organization which supports over 160 children, youth and adults with special needs by providing residential housing, day program, employment supports training and respite services.But the demand for services can’t be ignored. There are over 526 adults waiting for housing, over 570 youth and adults waiting for employment/day supports and 250 adults and 200 children requiring respite.PCL has an invested, visionary Board of Directors, 200 dedicated employees, and an award- winning senior leadership team. Our core values: a person-centred approach, community connection, family involvement, excellence in leadership and staff, and collaborative partnerships, align wonderfully with the mission and vision of SVP.We strongly believe in a collaborative approach to service delivery as exhibited with our recent partnership with Senstar Corp in Waterloo who helped us to develop a Technology Strategy through Capacity Canada’s TechMatch program.We are currently partnering with MennoHomes and St. Paul’s Lutheran Church to build a much-needed affordable housing project and community space which will allow PCL to expand programming and meet residential housing needs. We believe these examples of partnerships outside our own sector is exactly what SVP offers its investees which really gets us excited!  PCL offers the SVP’s the opportunity to work with a not for profit in the developmental services sector and learn more about this sectors’ work both locally and provincially. The SVP’s will help PCL strengthen its position within the community and expand its services through a multi-faceted approach including technology, fund development and marketing expertise","The most recent evaluation of the Executive Director by the Board of Directors reflects my style of management and key competencies and attributes:“deep knowledge of the sector (developmental services), collaboration, resilience, high integrity, innovative, strong financial oversight, highly respected in the community with sector partners, those supported, staff and board; ensures strategic objectives are achieved.”.Key achievements include ensuring a strong financial position as compared to many of our sister agencies provincially;  a collaborative community approach to strengthening our agency as demonstrated through our work with Capacity Canada executives, Senstar Corporation, MennoHomes, CORE Recreation Centre; development of a strong senior leadership team resulting in recent leadership awards and collaborative work with the Board resulting in a governance excellence award. ","PCL has an energetic, visionary and skilled Board of Directors.The Board utilized the skills of Capacity Canada executives to help develop a comprehensive 3 year strategic plan (2018- 2020) in conjunction with the ED and Senior Leadership team. The Board plans to engage Capacity Canada executives once again this year to move forward with a new strategic plan. Our forward-thinking Board engages in generative discussion through training topics delivered by Board members at their monthly meetings.","Last year the Board and Senior leadership team met for a day of visioning for our future with fundraising consultants to dream big and think about next steps for PCL. This work resulted in hiring fundraising consultants to move us forward into the future with a capital campaign currently underway. This is new and exciting work for the Board and our senior leadership team. Additionally, for the last four years the Board and ED have participated in Manulife’s Board Governance Boot Camps culminating in the Governance Excellence Award in November 2019. ","We currently do not anticipate any leadership changes within the agency other than a return of our Residential Services Director from her maternity leave (December 2020).  PCL currently has a very strong and long-term leadership team. Our current Human Resources Director has been with PCL for 21 years (she was in the Residential Services Director role for 19 of those years). Our Community Services Director has been with PCL for 19 years, our Finance and Operations Director for 6 years. Our Marketing and Communications Manager has been with PCL for 3 years. The ED has been with PCL for 21 years and is deeply committed to the organization.","PCL has a short term (0-6mths) succession plan developed for the Executive Director position. A permanent replacement would involve external recruitment and a plan is currently being developed for this process. Through the work of the Board’s Governance and Board Process committee, the Board recently approved the Board officer position descriptions which are included in the Board orientation manual. The committee is currently ensuring the recruitment process is clearly outlined in its Governance Policies and Procedures. The Board’s Governance and Board Process committee meets regularly and uses an annual workplan to ensure all necessary governance tasks are completed including the recruitment of officer positions for the Board. The current vice president will assume the president’s role in September 2020.",In 2018-19 PCL expanded our respite services and repurposed the home they vacated to address community need. This resulted in an approximate 45% growth financially and an increase in total beds from 30 to 40. As a result of this growth PCL added a Human Resources Director to provide necessary oversight to our growing staff teams as well as a book keeper/payroll staff position to assist our Finance and Operations Director who also provides oversight of our IT operations. We most recently redeployed our highly skilled administrative assistant to that of Marketing and Communications Manager to assist with our Fundraising Strategy. These changes have served to strengthen our senior leadership team and culminated in the Human Resource Leadership Strategy Award 2018 from our provincial colleagues. ," 1.In response to the ever-changing politicized government funding climate and the increasing waitlist for our services, PCL has developed a fundraising strategy to increase our autonomy and amount of funds we receive. PCL has a long-term core group of donors who are phenomenally loyal and generous. Through our capital campaign we will increase the funds we require through an expanded donor base which will increase the number of individuals we serve. We want SVP’s help with the execution of this strategy. 2.With Capacity Canada’s TechMatch Program, PCL developed a technology strategy to create efficiencies and improve service delivery. PCL has received some government funding to implement a pilot project but would benefit from the SVP’s expertise to determine the right way to go about implementing this strategy to maximize our impact and create the efficiencies we are seeking and to recommend how we can strengthen our current infrastructure to achieve these goals. 3.One of PCL’s strategic goals is to develop a marketing and rebranding strategy. While our recent awards have certainly provided significant community exposure, we need guidance to develop a formalized marketing strategy. PCL realizes our name doesn’t tell the community what we do or who we are. We need to consider how a name change can help us to move forward into the future and allow us to expand into other areas of service delivery which could lead to other creative, innovative partnership opportunities. 
","PCL measures goals annually from an individualized perspective for those supported. PCL uses surveys to measure success of programming and to improve upon service delivery with staff, families and those we support.The Senior Leadership team meets monthly to review strategic initiatives/objectives which is reported to the PCL Board through the ED's report. PCL measures risk through a Ministry risk assessment tool and has been consistently identified as low risk in Human Resources, IT, Services and Supports, Governance and Financial Management. PCL recently received 100% compliance ranking for Quality Assurance Measures from MCCSS for 3 of its programs. Growth of impact is a challenge to determine from a quantitative perspective as impact is often exhibited through anecdotal qualitative responses to service delivery and demonstrated Ministry confidence. (See links in question 39)","PCL has long been recognized for its out of home respite programs for both children and adults. PCL is viewed by its Ministry funders as innovative, responsive and the ‘go to’ agency whenever crisis occurs in our community. PCL firmly believes in a collaborative approach to service delivery and one example is our unique Computer Apprenticeship Program in partnership with both local school boards. Each semester we teach special needs youth digital literacy skills to help them develop necessary skills they need to be successful in our community. Another example is our collaborative work with Capacity Canada over the years have helped us to strengthen our governance model, create meaningful and impactful strategic plans and develop the technology strategy we need to improve our operations. It is this collaborative cross-sectoral approach to service delivery that sets PCL apart.  ","Provincially, the developmental service sector finds itself in crisis and has developed an action plan to address the crossroads it finds itself in. Cross-sectoral collaborations and partnerships have never been more necessary and critical at this time of self-reflection and innovative thinking. Our exciting partnership with MennoHomes and St. Paul’s Lutheran Church will allow us to develop an affordable housing project, community centre, kitchen and worship space. PCL plans to relocate its current day program to this new location, thereby saving rental costs, and funds will be redirected to increase service to others in the community. Our technology strategy has come at the right time for PCL. We intend on utilizing up to 10 apartments and use technology to encourage and develop independent living. The goal is to redirect staff costs to serve others on the wait list. ","See additional links from our website which demonstrates impact of our services:

Sanguen connects with people, including those who
use drugs, to provide health and social care.

(2) Vision
We’re working towards a future where everyone in our
community is accepted and cared for in the way they need to
thrive.
","(1) Elevator Pitch
Sanguen Health Centre (Sanguen) is a designated Hepatitis C Treatment provider for Wellington County and Waterloo Region. The individuals we work with often experience high degrees of social marginalization as a result of their mental health struggles, substance use, poverty, and unstable housing. Our services include physician and nursing services, hepatitis testing and treatment, psycho-social support, counselling, education, harm reduction, and outreach services. 

Sanguen has evolved its programs to include mobile outreach and primary health care to reach people who cannot access the healthcare and social service systems in traditional ways. In 2017, Sanguen’s community health van was a recipient of the provincial Minister’s Medal Honour Roll. Sanguen Health Centre is also the lead agency for a Ministry-funded safe consumption space in Kitchener.

(2) Fit with SVP’s Mandate
The need for Sanguen’s unique services has quickly grown as the number of deaths due to opioids and other substances has risen in recent years. This quick growth has placed a strain on the processes, policies, and people of the charity. An investment of time, money, and talent by Social Venture Partners Waterloo Region into Sanguen at this stage in its development can support the charity to accelerate its growth while maintaining the high quality medical care that it provides to people who experience social marginalization.
","Dr. Chris Steingart decided to leave his position as the Head of Infection Prevention and Control at Grand River and St. Mary’s Hospitals in 2007 to create the province’s first charitable Hepatitis C service organization because he saw the need for specialized care for the complex medical and psycho-social needs of his patients. He demonstrates his continued commitment by providing medical, social, and psychological support to the Region’s most marginalized patients. 

Chris has brought together and empowered a dedicated team of nurses, social support workers, outreach workers, and peer support workers who are not just exceptional at what they do, but how they do it. Under Chris’ leadership, the Sanguen team meets people where they are at, without stigma, to address pressing health challenges in collaboration with other mission-driven organizations.
","Sanguen’s Board of Directors is comprised of community leaders and medical professionals who share a commitment to the organization's vision of ‘working towards a future where everyone in our community is accepted and cared for in the way they need to thrive.’

Over the past 6 months, the Board of Directors has overseen a strategic planning process that has not only reconsidered the strategic focus of Sanguen, but also the role of the Board. New budgetary and governance policies and procedures are being developed in order to better support the work of Sanguen’s senior leadership team. 
","The Board of Directors and the Executive Director have worked closely together on the strategic planning process. Key inputs into the strategic planning process have included a full-day Board and staff planning retreat, and special meetings for Directors and senior leadership (led by the Executive Director) to address key questions.

Directors report that they enjoy their role with Sanguen and working with the Executive Director. This is evidenced by the long tenure of Directors on the Sanguen Board (see attached list of current Board of Directors). 
","Dr. Steingart and the other members of Sanguen’s senior leadership team are deeply committed to the mission and vision of Sanguen, and no leadership changes are expected within the next three years.

Dr. Steingart expects to be with Sanguen for many years to come. 
","The strategic planning process has identified Executive Director succession planning as an action item to be completed within the next three years. Possible mid-term strategies to prepare for succession include hiring an additional physician and a managing director. Both hires would have the effect of increasing organizational capacity and impact, while reducing succession risks. ","Governance and Planning
The strategic planning process is an intentional act of engaging the Board, senior leadership, and staff in considering the current position of Sanguen, the opportunities and risks ahead, actions required to increase impacts. A key outcome of this process has been increased collaboration between the Board and front-line staff.

Partnerships
In partnership with the Region and Ministry, Sanguen recently launched a safe consumption space in Kitchener. The partnership has already led to a reduction in overdose deaths, and a significant increase in the budget and scope of operations of Sanguen. 

Resources
Telus Health has donated to Sanguen the resources to purchase and equip a new primary care bus that will operate across Waterloo Region. This is an important tool to provide care for marginalized populations with limited access to traditional medical services. 
","Sanguen has experienced an important period of growth over the past several years, including (1) launching mobile health vans, (2) expanding operations to Guelph and surrounding townships, (3) launching a safe consumption space in Kitchener, and (4) acquiring a bus for the provision of primary care. 

To sustain the gains from this fast growth, Sanguen requires support from SVP to:
(1) Develop internal governance, budgeting, and human resources policies that can be enacted across geographic communities and focus areas;
(2) Help the Board enact the strategic plan, including assessing the opportunity cost of different forms of future growth;
(3) Consider new funding models that will allow for additional physicians and front-line staff to be hired; 
(4) Develop a communications and engagement strategy that not only supports Sanguen to increase donor attraction and retention, but evolves the public conversation about the medical needs of marginalized individuals in Waterloo Region; and
(5) Identify the metrics and stories that Sanguen should report back to the community on an ongoing basis to substantiate its impact. 
","Each of Sanguen’s programs result in a unique impact. For example, Sanguen’s community health vans support people who may use drugs, or are otherwise marginalized and face barriers to accessing primary care (e.g. harm reduction, nursing), basic supports (e.g. food, hygiene), and services (e.g. ODSP registration). Beneficiaries are 22% youth, 71% adults, 7% senior, 60% male, and 40% female. 
Sanguen’s vans operate in Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, and Guelph. Welington-Duffering-Guelph Public Health evaluated the outcomes achieved by Sanguen’s Guelph operations between 2017 and 2019:
* 8,171 visits (2,743 unique)
* 22% are ‘24 and under’, 71% are adults
* 95% reported being healthier and safer
* 44% of visitors received a referral (e.g. rehab, counselling)
* Visitors accessed food (91%), hygiene supplies (67%), and clothing (47%)
","Mobile clinics and fixed clinics in the same neighbourhood have been found to attract different populations. Mobile clinics attract younger clients, people who use drugs (particularly needle drugs), people engaged in sex work, and those not enrolled in a treatment program.

Approximately 2,000 mobile clinics provide 6.5 million visits annually across the U.S. In Canada, the model is much less developed and Sanguen is an important leader in this space. Other prominent examples include:
(1) The Alex (Calgary): Operates a fleet that includes youth and dental buses.
(2) Sherbourne Health Centre (Toronto): Launched in 1996.

Sanguen’s mobile care van launched in Waterloo Region in 2015 and Guelph in 2017. Sanguen’s safe consumption space launched in 2019 as one of the first such locations in Canada, and the only location in Waterloo Region. 
","Three key challenges that Sanguen faces are:
(1) Quick growth requires development of internal capacity to ensure organizational sustainability. Examples include a more robust budgeting process, and improved human resources policies and supports;
(2) Diversifying revenue sources to allow Sanguen to respond to changing needs (e.g. increase food and winter supplies at mobile health vans) that are beyond the scope of funding agreements; and
(3) Critical assessment of new growth opportunities (both in terms of expansion to other communities and development of new service offerings) to ensure strategic focus and impact maximization. 

These three challenges are also opportunities, as they stem from the continued growth of Sanguen as demand increases for the charity’s unique service offerings.
","We look forward to the opportunity to discuss our application further, and are happy to provide additional resources. 

We also welcome any suggestions from SVP on other potential projects that the Partners identify based on their experience working with other charitable organizations. 

Thank you for this great opportunity!

Sometimes, daily pressures parents face isolate us from that community just when we need it most.

For nearly 40 years, Extend-A-Family Waterloo Region has served families who have a child with a disability, from selecting a support worker who becomes an extension of their village and providing a break for the people we serve and their families through Respite, to navigating their provincial funding and finding the services they need. We simultaneously invest in community development, seeking to nurture belonging and recognition that everyone has gifts and contributions to share with others.  

We strongly believe that we are better together and are not self-reliant. We know our efforts will be bolstered by engaging with partners who bring to the table expertise that we lack, along with new perspectives that will strengthen our planning processes and introduce new ideas. 

We are funded by the province to provide direct service to children and adults with developmental disabilities.

We creatively invest in the broader community to foster a community that recognizes the gifts and contributions of those with developmental disabilities, reducing the reliance on our micro work. This macro work can be difficult to describe and does not always demonstrate clear short-term outcomes. Long-term impact results can be difficult to measure. 

Empowering capacity development has ripple effects in parts of other peoples’ lives.  
We hope our partners can help us articulate this more clearly, and identify measurable outcomes.
","""Al embodies everything EAFWR stands for in both his working and personal life. He has the capacity to see the forest for the trees, recognizing the overall needs of the organization with a positive and powerful voice for EAFWR.""  

Years of developmental services experience along with extensive leadership training, a collaborative approach and an ability to engage his team and partners in achieving goals with a servant leadership approach. In the first 2 years of his tenure, navigated turnover at both the Board and Senior Leadership level; completed a leadership development program for our managers; and implemented a new set of software for our customers and finance team. EAFWR worked within our budget and experienced significant growth in the fee for service programs, created a new strategic plan, and have committed to pursue accreditation with Imagine Canada in 2020.
","The Board of Directors is strategically comprised of varied skills and experiences, including accounting, legal, business, and education. One half of the Board is comprised of family members of supported individuals. We have updated our Board Committee structure to three: Governance, Finance, and Human Resources. And we have joined Imagine Canada’s Standards Community to prepare for accreditation.
","At the Board meeting held on September 29, 2018, our Board made the decision to pursue accreditation with Imagine Canada. The period of preparation, during which we joined the Standards Community, involved review and revision of many Board and Staff policies, and adjustments to various governance and administration practices. The joint staff-board effort to prepare for accreditation has strengthened relationships and alignment to our vision, mission and values. The process is building confidence and excitement internal to EAFWR and we look forward to achieving this milestone together.
 
","We have introduced new Board members and new leadership team members relatively seamlessly during the past two years. We anticipate the potential hiring of one more member of our leadership team in the coming months. This change will strengthen our organization and in no way deter from our capacity to engage with SVP. 
","Three members of our Board, including the Vice-Chair, serve as the Chairs of our Board Committees. This experience will help them prepare to serve as our Board Chair upon the completion of our current Chair’s term. Each of them, and several other board members, have completed Capacity Canada’s Board Governance Bootcamp to strengthen their understanding of governance responsibilities. Our recently hired Director of Programs has a strong leadership background within our field. He is also currently completing an MBA, supported by EAFWR. He is well-equipped to serve as an emergency, interim or even successor Executive Director. Further, we have invested in leadership development training for all members of our management team.
","Emotional Intelligence for Personal and Professional Development Workshop was provided for all staff members, to understand EI and its value, to increase self-awareness, learn techniques to manage their own and others' emotions more skillfully.

The KW Library of Things provides supportive employment opportunities for those in our community who face barriers to employment.  
","1. The City of Kitchener is our landlord and our lease expires in 2022. Ideally, we will work with other community-minded organizations and find a new home in a community hub, where we can work with other agencies, finding efficiencies in our administration and multi-resource options onsite for those who use our services. We would benefit greatly from SVP engaging with us in exploring locations, potential partners and funding models.
 
2. EAFWR wants to develop an organizational structure that is both efficient and sufficient. Our finance and human resource team currently have limited capacity to effectively do their work, with the high volume of work pushing beyond their capacity. We would like to fully review our capacity and structure to build for the future, leveraging our new software for efficiency and excellent customer service.

3. We are developing relationships with affordable housing providers to improve access to suitable affordable housing for adults with developmental disabilities. Many people have difficulty finding suitable housing along with the supports that can help them live successfully in their own home. Part of the issue is that support is found in the developmental services sector, while housing is found through the municipality. This is an important area of work in which we can have a significant impact for people who are desperately in need of suitable housing.

","From an initial gathering around a kitchen table in 1981, serving just 14 families, EAFWR has since been entrusted as the sole administrator of Special Services at Home (SSAH) funding in Waterloo Region. Our community has since grown to more than 2000 families, with more coming to us weekly.

Our workforce is steadily growing, with more than 300 employees offering direct support services in the community. The demand for our community-based and individualized services continues to grow, and EAFWR’s community awareness initiatives are seeing more engagement.

We measure event and training attendance, public appearances of EAFWR representatives, social media growth and engagement, donor origins, program growth and employee satisfaction.  

We navigate changing government policies and funding and continue to adapt and respond to fluid gaps and needs in services and community.
","We weave our mandate of Community, Dignity and Belonging into every aspect of our work. We differ from other DS agencies by investing in Community Development, nurturing local communities to be places of belonging and interdependence for all. We focus on the individual as we assist in navigating resources, working tirelessly to create inclusive opportunities for people to participate in our community. We always put the person first.

The sole administrator in WR of Special Services At Home funding, we have an adaptable infrastructure that promotes growth and improved services for those we support. We work to align the individual with a worker to ensure cohesiveness. 

We are implementing a new system that includes consumer management and financial system that will provide our families with access to their budgets.
","As a non-profit organization that receives provincial funding and resources as a primary source of funding, and during this uncertain fiscal climate, we have been pushed to demonstrate our efficiency and effectiveness. While there have been shifts in the funding model, there has been no follow up by the government to assess our needs. We see the need to diversify our funding revenue streams and resources and explore new options, so we are in a more viable position to endure and sustain. We also need to be aware of and forecast potential shifts and changes to how we operate in the near future, including partnering and/or merging with like-minded organizations. We need to continue to demonstrate our ability to provide the best possible service we can, while also forecasting and anticipating shifts that may impact our organization. 
","As one of many developmental services agencies in the region, the innovation we experience is often shared with other organizations. Through affiliations with OASIS (oasisonline.ca), WRFN(wrfn.info/), DSPAC and Children and Youth Planning Table (www.childrenandyouthplanningtable.ca), EAFWR’s collective success means a richer and fuller community where everyone belongs.

Our Vision: A community where everyone feels at home – valued, connected and empowered.
","At Community Support Connections, we work with 700 volunteers to help our clients live in their own homes by promoting the health of the whole person – mind and body. Our services are strategically focused in four areas to maximize our impact: nutrition, physical health, social wellbeing, and help at home.
We help people live independently and with dignity, and we create personal connections with them along the way. Every touchpoint with us conveys genuine care for our clients and it shows in the high-quality services we offer. 
SVP’s mandate as a partnership for giving perfectly reflects our approach to creating lasting social impact in our community by working together to create more meaningful impact than we could make alone.
We know we could not do what we do without the help of our volunteers, and more than 800 donors. Our community partners provide free space for our programming and offices to make our staff more accessible to the most vulnerable of clients. We now have over 100 program sites and have intake staff working from 20 partner locations or housing buildings throughout the region.
We build strong and lasting relationships with our clients and their caregivers, volunteers, donors, and community partners to foster an environment where people feel they belong and can make a difference. 
We help bring people, ideas, and opportunities together. We work collaboratively with our partners to ensure equity, accessibility, and seamless service delivery by leveraging local strengths, expertise, goodwill, and generosity. We work with students and local tech companies to introduce new practices and efficiencies into our work, while moving forward as part of our changing healthcare system.","The ED has focused on empowering decision making across the organization with a foundation of trust and capability. This has enabled the ED to prioritize building strategic alliances and increasing our community footprint as well driving OHT membership and integration forward. Additionally, Board recruitment has been set as a priority, transforming the Board via strategic targeting of corporate leaders with relevant skills sets. Following the launch of our Cultural Working Group, we have focused on a recruitment strategy that has resulted in the hiring of key positions to meet organizational gaps in areas such as Finance and HR.","Our Board functions under the Policy Governance model, which focuses on the establishment and monitoring of value-based policies to further the mission and strategic planning of the organization. 
In 2019, our Board was focused on new initiatives around our brand refresh, driving our social enterprise forward, explorations of building a new facility, and discussions around alliances or integrations with other agencies. Recently, they've been exploring a strategic advisory group comprised of community leaders/strategic thinkers to provide critical advice on organizational growth and direction.
","The ED and Board have worked closely together to identify a common set of priorities including the future state of CSC in each of our local Ontario Health Teams. While the ED has been the regular executive lead, Board members have jointly collaborated in strategic planning session with other organizations/governors with each bringing their own expertise in governance, finance, legal, and other areas. As the healthcare landscape has changed, these joint activities have resulted in CSC being prominently represented as a full member at both our local OHTs going forward.","The Executive Director and senior leadership team are committed to a common set of goals around culture, capacity building, and innovation. Based on this, the direction of our strategic plan, and our completed review of roles and responsibilities among the senior leadership team, we have hired a new Director of Finance & Administration and a Human Resources Manager. With these changes bringing much needed expertise in their respective areas, we feel no further changes are required and that we are prepared to meet the goals outlined in our strategic plan. Our current Senior Leadership team have more than 30 years of dedication to Community Support Connections across four positions.","We are committed to ensuring the stability and evolution of the organization through planned and unplanned transitions in our human resources. Our succession plan: 
-Assesses current and future needs based on strategic and operational priorities; 
Identifies suitable candidates, ensuring they are provided with training and development necessary; 
-Matches needs with capabilities of the existing work force; and identifies opportunities or plans to manage gaps that might arise when individuals in key positions leave or are promoted. 
Recruitment for our Board Chair is typically internal, with existing board members joining the executive before serving as board chair. Executive members can self-identify, or be nominated. If there are multiple people interested in a position, the board would vote on the seat.
","Increasing revenue is critical to ensuring services meet their ever-growing demand as our population ages. While we enhance our fundraising programs, we’ve investing in a grant database, allowing us to efficiently research, identify, and apply to a variety of funders new to us. This has already been successful in securing support from multiple grantors who haven’t supported us in the past and appear to be promising repeat funders.
We’ve created a new frozen menu for our Meals on Wheels clients to complement our hot meals, allowing for us to expand production and supply to other agencies, individuals, and corporate partners for a new and sustainable revenue source.
We also identified the need to strengthen our brand, and after conducting surveys and focus groups with over 400 respondents, we worked with a digital marketing firm to craft a new brand and website we’re currently unveiling.
","CSC is aggressively pursuing Financial Sustainability, including an emphasis to engage philanthropists/granting foundations, and corporations. We are launching our Social Enterprise; a frozen meal menu we've developed. While this would generate significant undesignated revenue for CSC, support in the areas of product development, marketing, distribution, sales, and branding would be valuable. We have also been exploring buying and redeveloping our current site into a Hub for seniors, including shared community organization office space, program space, professional offices (dental, optometrist, etc.) and retail, generating sustainable rental income to support organizational programs and future growth.

We are investing heavily in the development of new models of Culture/HR. For HR we have hired a new Human Resources Manager role to lead the redevelopment of our outdated processes and software. Culture includes developing a comprehensive Board cultivation strategy to recruit senior community leaders/thinkers to build a visionary board to guide CSC.

We are exploring technology solutions to our operational challenges and have added a new Client Management System (Alayacare) new accounting software (NetSuite) and partnered with a local startup (HiRide) to “Uberize” our transportation fleet. To achieve our end goal of creating a seamless digital experience for clients/caregivers via tablet, smartphone, etc., we still require advice and guidance on our digital strategy.
","We report clients served and program stats to the community in our annual impact report, quarterly to the Ministry of Health, and monthly to our Board. Our Quality Improvement Plan and client and staff satisfaction surveys identify improvement areas.  
Feedback states over 90% of clients site our services as contributing to their quality of life and ability to stay at home.
Our impact has grown significantly over the years, not just in number of clients served, but in how we do business. Our intake staff have office locations embedded in their service areas (i.e., partner locations, community centres, seniors’ apartment buildings). As potential clients get to know these workers through casual interactions, they are more comfortable accessing services. Impact on clients has increased as we’ve added more preventative care like caregiver support services and falls prevention programming. 
","CSC is the result of a 2008 merger of four smaller agencies, each with a long history of improving the quality of life for local seniors and adults with disabilities. 
In the subsequent ten-year period, CSC realized significantly increased capacity by leveraging the resulting change into a client focused, innovation embracing culture, and redirecting redundant administration to direct service. 
We are embracing technology at a level unique among our peer organizations, building capacity for future client and organizational demands. This includes developing a digital customer strategy as well as cloud-based/remote options for staff.
Last year we increased equity across multiple programs via more diverse program service options as well as the introduction of our sliding scale fee model whereby client fees reflect their income levels.
","As Ontario’s seniors’ population doubles by 2041, our growth is only limited by our resources. Our largest challenges and opportunities revolve around securing sufficient volunteer and financial support. As volunteer trends change, our team has built relationships to engage students, and is working to increase the number of businesses volunteering in our garden, kitchen, and by adopting a Meals on Wheels route. Insights into B2B marketing would be valuable.
With our involvement in two new Ontario Health Teams, the uncertain political/funding climate highlights our need to advance our frozen meal social enterprise which has the potential to generate significant net new revenues to be reinvested back into our services including.
The challenges around the development and integration of our digital services with the OHTs present great opportunities as well.","Community Support Connections is committed to organizational transformation to meet the growing needs of our clients and community. We are entrepreneurial in our vision and scope, looking to embrace private sector strategies to guide and underpin our future needs.
We are gradually leveraging partnerships to increase our capacity through incorporating technology, and innovating on our existing programs and practices, but would benefit greatly from the fresh perspectives and networks of the members of SVP.

Our Mission - Providing innovative opportunities that enable the people we support to reach their goals and achieve recognition of their value in the community.","Sunbeam Centre is an innovative charitable not-for-profit service provider delivering programs, services and supports to children, youth, adults and seniors with an intellectual disability and/or autism, and their families.  Since 1956, when Pieter and Johanna Vos welcomed a child with a developmental disability into their home on Frederick Street in Kitchener, to 1966, when  Sunbeam evolved into a non-profit corporation under a volunteer Board of  Directors, to today with Sunbeam providing a broad spectrum of programs and services to the community, our commitment to serving individuals living with developmental disabilities, and their families, remains strong.  Our Community Living Services division (residential care, respite care, day programs, and other therapeutic support services) solely serve clients in Waterloo Region.  Our other two divisions provide a vast spectrum of intake, assessment, navigation, coordinated service planning, service resolution, transition  and host family programs and services to individuals of all ages (living with developmental disabilities) across all of Waterloo Region, Wellington, Halton, Peel, and Dufferin. Sunbeam has deep roots in Waterloo Region, being a trusted provider of care and services meeting the unique needs of individuals of all ages living with extremely complex developmental, cognitive and physical disabilities, with dignity and respect.  We recognize that each person has inherent value and gifts, and can make meaningful contributions to their community.","I believe that the senior leadership team, the board of directors and the managers and staff I have interacted with would describe me as: approachable, knowledgeable, fair, ethical, competent, trustworthy and having a strong client centred focus.  I take a very balanced,  collaborative and solution-focused approach to leadership.  I believe in strengthening autonomy across all levels of the organization - enabling high performance teamwork.  Communication and trust are key to fostering a healthy and effective workplace.  In 2018 I was the sole recipient of the annual Leadership Award from AdvantAge Ontario, recognizing my contributions to the long-term care sector.  I have had several occasions in my career to come into a struggling organization and turn things around for the better, and these are the experiences for which I am most proud.","The Board of Directors of Sunbeam Centre consists of a dedicated group of volunteers from the community, who bring their unique and varied skills, experiences and perspectives to the table to provide governance oversight to our organization.  The board has recently developed a Board Composition Matrix to match the desired skill sets for our board of directors, with the skills and experience brought to the table by each board member.  This matrix is an extremely effective and objective decision-making tool to guide the board member recruitment process.   ","I will refer to the strategic planning exercise (for 2017-20) headed by the Board of Directors in 2017.  The Board went through a a very collaborative process to develop the strategic plan, engaging senior management, staff, clients, families and other stakeholders.  The strategic plan is available on our website (www.sunbeamcentre.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Sunbeam_Strategic_Plan_2017-2020.pdf).  Furthermore, the Board and Senior Management have aligned annual workplans with the strategic plan, with close monitoring and progress updates to ensure success.","Given that I have had several succession planning discussions already with board members and senior leaders at Sunbeam, I would assess that there is a chance of no more than 1 senior leader retiring within the next 3 to 5 years.  It is encouraging to note that most of the senior leadership team, as with many of the staff, has extremely long tenure with the organization.  Therefore with this collective body of knowledge, I would not see a great risk to leadership continuity over the next 3 years.","For my role as ED, during the recent recruitment and selection process I clearly articulated my wish to be at the helm of Sunbeam for an extended period should I be chosen as the new ED.  Having lived and worked in the KW/C community for approx. 30 years, I was very aware of the crucial services provided by Sunbeam to the community, and I am humbled by being chosen to lead Sunbeam.  Related to this, I have recently initiated a revision to our organizational structure (minor not major) in order to better align our structure with good succession planning principles.  From a Board Chair perspective, a Vice Chair exists and the annual general meeting is the forum used to ensure that all ""officer"" positions on the board are filled (Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary, Treasurer, Governance Committee Chair).  The Board Composition Matrix is also an important succession planning tool.","Sunbeam has a trusted reputation with our funders at the Ministry of Children Community and Social Services (MCCSS) such that the Ministry looks to us for innovative solutions to meet challenging care/support needs for individuals with developmental disabilities.  Sunbeam has a long history of working closely with the Ministry, and other human services organizations to find the right solutions to meet clients' needs.  Sunbeam's ""system view"" rather than ""self-serving sole focus"" view is respected and relied upon by our sector.  This has also allowed Sunbeam to build unique expertise in complex areas such as service resolution which enables us to be dynamic, innovative and responsive to current and anticipated future needs.","Sunbeam has experienced significant growth in recent years, from an $18 million operating budget in 2012-13 to a $44 million operating budget in 2019-20.  Much of this growth has come from additional functions and programs, many at the Developmental Services system / sector level, rather than at the service provider level, which have been taken on by Sunbeam at the encouragement of, and with the support of the Ministry of Children Community and Social Services (MCCSS).  There are many pressures in the community which directly impact our clients and their families.  Sunbeam is well-positioned for growth, and we would benefit greatly from the skills, insights, experience of SVP Partners to help us establish a process for strategic growth which is needs-based, evidence-driven and intentional.  Just two examples of pressures are:  (1) Individuals in ""alternate level of care"" (ALC) beds at local hospitals, who are unable to return to their home because of ongoing care/support needs.  Any such individuals who are also living with a developmental disability can have even greater challenges with finding an appropriate environment to transition to which will meet their unique needs.  (2)  There is a growing need in the developmental services sector for programs, supports and services to meet the specific needs of older adults.  Needs such as dementia care, responsive behaviours, medically fragile, social isolation and more would be important considerations for this client population. ","A key measure of results and impact is number of clients served, and Sunbeam has consistently met or exceeded such targets set by the Ministry (MCCSS).  The quality and results/outcomes of our services are truly what provide the social value of our work.  We are currently developing a ""Compliance Quality Assurance"" team to support the setting of quality performance indicators across all program areas, analyze progress and results, and embed continuous quality improvement (CQI) principles/ practices across the organization.  Having indicators, results and impacts determined at the local level, at times community specific, by the subject matter experts delivering services, and with input from stakeholders is extremely important to meeting the unique needs of the community served. Such an approach should also be a key informant to our strategic growth plan.","Sunbeam serves the needs of the most complex, most vulnerable individuals living with developmental disabilities.  Several of our residential care homes serve medically fragile and/or technology dependent clients requiring clinical supports on a 24/7 basis.  We also operate a home serving individuals living with Autism who present with significant behavioural challenges.  Sunbeam takes a very inclusive, non-judgmental and  client-focused approach to delivering its programs across the spectrum of ages (infants to seniors), abilities, and cultural / ethnocultural / faith backgrounds.  As we also provide several system/sector-wide functions across Waterloo Region and beyond, we continue to earn the trust of our clients, their families, and a broad network of developmental services and related organizations.  Sunbeam is very unique in the developmental services sector in this regard.","LIke many not-for-profit organizations which deliver services to vulnerable populations, Sunbeam is always faced with growing service demands from the community, and limited resources (funding, staff, leaders, strategic focus).  As previously indicated, our breadth and scope of programs and services is varied and diverse.  But with an organizational commitment to growth, it is very important that we take a strategic approach to developing our growth plan to optimize the use of our resources and to capitalize on our strengths and expertise.  With the trust and reputation that Sunbeam has with the community, peer agencies and the Ministry (MCCSS), Sunbeam needs to follow a comprehensive strategy for developing growth to help individuals and families in Waterloo Region better achieve their goals.","In 2019, prior to this ED opportunity being made available I joined a board committee of Reena..  Through this experience I learned about the excellent work done by Reena, as another sector-leading, innovative developmental services provider (please refer to:  http://www.reena.org/)   One of Reena's many residential programs in an innovative ""Intentional Community"", which I spoke about at length during my interview process with Sunbeam.  Developing an ""Intentional Community"" could be a very effective and innovative solution to meet many system pressures and client needs in Waterloo Region.","https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lGgjgCcvXmaDzKx7me6cYnwAzXEkeUir, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Fl3MqVzUYUtZzyZNkucMytajgrfEnWBT",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XV7LdwBUCYIUvFhuVQDDhcdlh3i9-hXB,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DQqQ3WZi3dESt0Pm3uopBlH6VVu6qc6C, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1OnxwnS7mMxst7EQXL9Fi16D9wF9xuewr",https://drive.google.com/open?id=10IzyD5w_twaff_R61VZ4nGyFuNiVW5Uq,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ClMpLTt1iP3KinQN-U4QLvNAYcecOKaG,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Rm3cBJ4cKlv-M998KoH2j4X6_YeWzJjp,

Woolwich Community Services (WCS) is recognized as an essential service and a one stop, not-for-profit social service agency. WCS provides supports, information and referrals to all residents living in Woolwich and Northern Wellesley Townships. WCS offers access to its 8 core programs and over 20 services through their Information Centre located in Elmira. Programs and supports are adapted to meet the residents’ needs and to support residents where they are currently, in their lives. Core programs offered are the Foodbank, Family Violence Prevention, Low German Family Support, Employment Services, Individual Support, Christmas Goodwill, Thrift Shop and Youth Centre. Several programs offered are coordinated to support low-income earning households eg: Foodbank and Christmas Goodwill, while others are suited for to meet the needs of all income levels eg: transportation to a medical appointment or Family Violence Prevention Program support. The dedication of 8 full-time and 6 part-time staff and the talents of several hundred Volunteers annually make WCS a trusted community agency. WCS has been providing community supports for 45 years, with the realization that “sometimes” we all need a little help. Social Venture Partners fits WCS larger vision by offering and coordinating the expertise required to meet the strategic directions recently developed. The recognized areas of focus for WCS are; sufficient and stable funding, community awareness through community and corporate partnerships, investment in employees and volunteer development and to provide program initiatives to meet community needs. Together, we can strengthen WCS to remain an effective, viable, trusted, financially secure social service agency working within this complex, unpredictable environment
","Those with who I share mutual respect within my working environment may describe me as honest, reliable, trustworthy, compassionate, hardworking, and dedicated. Managerially abilities may be described as; the ability to listen and be supportive, available and flexible, problem solver who provides support and direction.

I personally consider myself as an honest, fair creative problem solver, a team player with a strong work ethic. Top achievements would be my three fabulous, happy, healthy children! Work related top achievements would include the many programs that I have been able to create and implement over the years. As a result of listening to participants needs and building community partnerships these programs were established Backpack Program, Birthday Cupboard, Lunch Crunch, Adult Connect and a Youth Centre. 
","Woolwich Community Service Board consists of nine dedicated community members, support ranges from twenty six years to six months. Members are currently active or retired from self-employment, employed in the education field, social services and manufacturing. Members are active supporting the financial sustainability and promotion of the agency by volunteering with fundraising initiatives and attending promotional activities. In the spring all members met with staff and developed the 2019-2024 Strategic Plan. Members offered valuable insight from their level of expertise and experiences.","Woolwich Community Services recognized the Low Income Cut Offs used as a financial eligibility guideline when accepting participants to the assistance programs was not accommodating the minimum wage earners. As a result of consultations with staff, community and Board members a Low Income Cut Off ‘Plus’ financial eligibility  guideline was developed to include the minimum wages earners, making them eligible to receive the support from programs eg: Foodbank, Backpack and Christmas Goodwill offered by WCS.
","The only leadership change I foresee in the next three years is the retirement of the full-time Low German Family Support Coordinator, expected within the next 6 to 18 months.","Succession planning for the Board Chair position is part of the nomination process reviewed each May and voted on at the annual AGM in June. However, there is no plan in place if any of these members do not accept the nomination for Chair or Vice-Chair. Again, there is not an established succession plan in place for the Executive Director. A succession plan was developed in 2016 and could be reviewed for current needs. ","The Strategic Plan has been focused upon. Collaboration of all staff and Board members, with expertise of a community consultant we defined the following four priority focus areas. To continue to develop and implement a plan for sufficient and stable funding, continue to develop, build and increase community and corporate partners through community awareness, invest in employee and volunteer development and continue to meet the changing needs of the community through the implementation of new program initiatives. As a result, a new annual fundraising event the Coldest Night of the Year walk was initiated and providing financial success beyond our targeted goal. The event also strengthens and provides WCS with many new partnerships while broadening community awareness. Staff job descriptions are being reviewed and revised to meet current the objectives/goals of the staffing positions.
","SVP partners will provide the leadership, expertise, and mentoring necessary to meet the four areas of focus. Technology support; selection, training and implementation of a computer and telephone system  supporting staff with  confidential, accurate communication, coordination of programs, and participant information to obtain program data to evaluate programs. Organizational and Leadership Development/ Succession planning, the recruitment and support for all members, job description reviews, implement a strength based performance tool assisting with staff development/goal setting and a review of financial compensation for staff. Marketing and Revenue Generation: Focus on increasing the stability of revenue. Establish concrete, funding opportunities to meet current donor giving trends. Build capacity to implement corporate giving, on-line giving and planned giving programs.  The computer and telephone system will provide efficient use of staff time. Staff will receive messages directly from participants providing confidentiality. Program data collection is essential for evaluation and revision of programs. The detailed job descriptions, the ability to build on employees’ strengths, personal development/goal setting for their programs, and program participants are a benefit.  The stable, financial support for additional program opportunities, community partnerships and awareness will meet more participants’ needs and build a safe supportive community.
","Daily statistical information is collected, recording participants’ use of programs, length of time in the program and frequency of program use. Some programs use satisfaction surveys. Informal communication with participants is an effective method of data collection. Consultations with agency and community partnerships assist with collaborations and meeting resident’s needs. The cost of the program, attendance, the availability of resources to implement the program will all affect the program results. Growth has been recognized through the implementation of additional programs; the Lunch Crunch program offers fresh fruits, vegetables and other lunch items to provide for the two nutritional breaks at school and assists families with the increase cost for fresh foods. Last year Lunch Crunch Program provided over 15,500 lunches and has recently been established in two other Foodbanks.  ","Our approach to the community is through a trauma sensitive lens with the understanding that ‘SOMETIMES’ we all need a little help. Choice is essential when offering supports, opportunities, and the acceptance of people and their decisions. Volunteers within the community are essential to the success of our programs and are relied upon for time and talents. Collaboration and partnerships are essential to support our initiatives. Recently, we have secured funding support through joint agency funding applications. Currently, we receive Lyle S Hallman funding coordinated in partnership with 3 agencies in other rural region Townships. United Way funding has been approved through a joint application with two other Township agencies. At Woolwich Community Services, “the Sky is the Limit”.","Participant’s challenges due to the long term effects of living with housing instability and financial stresses; sometimes  result in poor physical and mental health, and the ability to access programs becomes a challenge. Expectations on staff time increases due to the complexities of the participant’s needs requiring multiple supports and more long-term support. Funding is threatened by changes to government focuses, personal interests and worldwide issues impacting donors giving. Government funding when offered does not offer annual financial increases to keep with the rate of inflation. Volunteers are aging and the next generation is not filling in the gap created. The opportunities to create a more formalized intentional revenue generating strategy to meet the changing views of donor giving will assist with the ability to grow programs to meet the needs of the residents.  ",The many years of service/employment of the dedicated and compassionate staff and volunteers speaks to the welcoming and trusted atmosphere of Woolwich Community Services. The variety of the programs and services offered is also a reflection of their commitment to provide all residents with opportunities for support.  Woolwich Community Services has developed many community partnerships and collaborations to be successful.,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RMI7hqBtJ1vtQagVv6a7sVe_oROzw1ZI,https://drive.google.com/open?id=10otgkC2Tn-4nD-jrFwzlM9uPcbNGFGZX,"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b3ppMdNC-GCea0hhuYL5mL-vPDr3D35-, https://drive.google.com/open?id=18oJ9LKW251I_0_ORa3YYWQ1QuFXrgJva, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kHIwHQF2QVxQh32qEyPrkJYmhMCbzIHp, https://drive.google.com/open?id=1I0M9FBMLy9GF5F82cHc7ps8qs1PcXGP0",https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iJNBxYe2BWglj8GtY0UO51T1yy29CdLi,https://drive.google.com/open?id=16GqyVS9FrxjznkAlvxitY4uqQAWJInYG,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1MX_6UUc857QDVaUxfOOxK_jyTH41wvUN,
