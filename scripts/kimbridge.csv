4/11/2020 23:48:20,Kinbridge Community Association,891470536 RR0001,Joe-Ann McComb,Joe-Annm@kinbridge.ca,,,"200 Christopher Drive, Cambridge",https://www.kinbridge.ca/,"This application is addressing the emerging and urgent need that the COVID-19 restrictions of social isolation/distancing has on the physical and mental well being of low income seniors, immunocompromised individuals (including children), individuals living with mental health issues, domestic violence victims, individuals living with addiction, and people at risk for becoming homeless. Our need is to connect to Community. Our community needs to connect.

Kinbridge Community Association works, supports, and serves in a catchment of Cambridge of 36,000. The Southwood and Christopher Champlain neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods have higher than regional averages of low-income children, families and seniors. Data shows us low income individuals, particularly seniors and children are higher risk for sickness and immunocompromised diseases including diabetes, asthma, pneumonia, skin abscesses and sinus/ear infections, thus increasing the risk during this pandemic. Our neighbours face increased social and economic barriers and live with an elevated risk of being victims or perpetrators of crime. In the past 15 months our communities have experienced 2 violent fatalities as the result of gun violence.

Kinbridge Community Association has been actively working in these neighbourhoods and is a recognized and trusted community builder and partner. The essential need of an individuals well being comes immediately after ensuring food security and safe shelter. Well being is the experience of health and happiness. It includes having good mental health, life satisfaction, sense of purpose and the ability to manage stress. Feelings of well being are fundamental to the overall health of the individual, enabling them to successfully overcome difficulties.

Social isolation is incredibly different for some of our neighbours. It truly is isolation. When homes lack the financial resources to have the ability to maintain internet connection, many of the families and individuals we work with are now experiencing increased disconnect as a result of our current situation. Children are unable to go online to connect with classmates and teachers. Seniors unable to connect with family, and families are at a disadvantage when searching for assistance and resources. Even with some of the measures being put in place by schools, some of our neighbours will still be missed. 
 
Low income, mental health, physical disabilities, addiction, domestic violence and no internet increase the negative impact that this current crisis and its mandated social isolation has on our neighbours well being. Due to these barriers families and individuals in our neighbourhoods will experience higher needs and see increased negative impact if there are no intervention measures taken. We need to combat the increased social isolation measures and its negative health and well being impacts. Providing free access to wifi and internet connection in our low income communities, as well as moving programs to an online model will allow us to take the first steps in reaching our isolated neighbours and bridging the gap this crisis is creating.",20000,"The use of social media and social networking has become a significant force in social interaction, community development and engagement. There is strong evidence to suggest that social networks can improve the socio-economic well-being of communities.

In this application we want to successfully use existing space and technology to innovate in more subtle ways. Implementing new community engagement strategies and solutions that are both low cost, far reaching and effective. We want to be able to innovate ways to stay connected with our most isolated and hard to engage neighbours. We want to improve the quality and interactive ability of our online presence which will positively impact participants overall quality of life living in the confines of social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.

We want to create free community internet space, with access to free, 24 hour a day wifi. We want to create a lending library for our neighbours, young and old alike, so they can borrow and use Chromebooks at their leisure and return when finished. We want to increase our online presence and facilitate a menu of programs to stay connected with our neighbours online. 
We work very hard at creating equitable community and learned very early in this crisis that COVID-19 works against this. Lower income families and individuals without internet are at a complete loss. By having increased bandwidth so community members can access internet sitting outside of our community centres we are effectively empowering people. This allows people to provide for themselves, find resources, supports our ESL community; children can connect for schoolwork, parents can find resources and personal supports, seniors can Facetime family. Internet connection is an essential tool for prevention moving forward.

Kinbridge staff along with community volunteers have come together to create a broad menu of online engagement opportunities which include but are not limited to gentle exercise, craft creations, sports skills, Yoga, tea times, community conversations, cooking on a budget, check ins and gardening.

Our staff working from home will be doing wellness calls with our present participants and neighbours we engaged with pre physical distancing. In addition to our online presence, we are in a position to create new strategies for working in collaboration with community partners now and to be ready to respond immediately when restrictions are lifted. Recognizing that people's needs, abilities and increased barriers are different, and many will need support.

Core activities related to this application include creating a Chromebook lending library for all people to access in both the Southwood and Christopher Champlain Neighbourhoods. We will increase our bandwidth at all three of our permeant locations; 2 located in low income housing complexâ€™s to be completed first and one in a busy community park. Increased IT support for safety and monitoring of these community wifi spaces, program resources staffing related to the lending library and online program facilitation, volunteer management, capacity building for collaboration, and the creation of a Workplace Wellness Program supporting the staff and volunteers working to support our communities.
","We have a varied approach to creating a Workplace Wellness program for coping during COVID-19 and beyond. This includes 24/7 counselling, stress management, and self care strategies Employee Assistance Program, virtual mindfulness and fitness to webinars- and recognition programs for our staff and volunteers.

We would increase our employee benefits package to include access to an Employee Assistance Program through our insurance and benefits provider at Sun Life. Their program can help support individuals through crisis and traumatic events, family relationships, depression, anxiety, stress, dependency issues, wellness issues, health and fitness coaching, and nutrition support.

We have created a Health and Wellness Committee to research and coordinate weekly online connections for staff and volunteers to decompress and learn coping strategies. Fitness, learning online, webinars on work strategies will be an ongoing invitation for us to connect on a social and equitable level.

Many of our staff and volunteers are now home accessing the CERB program. They are still apart of our team and community. Our Wellness program includes maintaining these connections and including these people to access our program initiatives.

A high percentage of our staff and volunteers who work with Kinbridge also live within our neighbourhoods, thus increasing the need for a comprehensive approach to our wellbeing. We have taken a careful and mindful approach to how we manage our work, workload, communication and next steps as we navigate through COVID-19 restrictions. Given these circumstances we feel Workplace Wellbeing is of utmost importance to moving forward together and maintaining the health and wellbeing not only of our organization but of our community. We are allocating 25% of our overall application request dedicated to the health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers.","Kinbridge Board of Directors has been meeting regularly monitoring the impacts of COVID-19 on our organization.

They have set up continued meetings working with senior staff as we move from mobilizing during this pandemic to creating stabilization. The Board is discussing the opportunties of keeping cash liquid, partnering opportutites and the various government programs that Kinbriddge can qualify for.

Kinbridge continues working with all partners it presently collaborates with the view for conintuing services not only now but in 6 months. Discussions will soon begin as communication with funders continues. ",
