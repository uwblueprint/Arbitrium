The implications of this pandemic have profound effects on mental health as we are living through unprecedented experiences.

The emotional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are far-reaching and we have yet to see their full ramifications.  Everyone is experiencing added stressors to their lives; some people are working the front lines, others have been laid off, others worry about their own health or that of loved ones, and many more are experiencing a sense of heightened anxiety. 

Those currently struggling with mental health challenges are particularly vulnerable and it is increasingly important to ensure that everyone gets the mental health support they need to avoid increased demands for intensive treatment and further strain on police and hospital services. 

This application is submitted as a self-organized network application because the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region has worked together for a long period of time. The CCWR is a community-based partnership between six counselling service providers within the Waterloo Region ensuring people have access to quality and coordinated services, while supporting them to improve their mental health and wellbeing. 

At time of great uncertainty and anxiety, we are working together to lessen the financial stress of accessing services.  We believe that cost should never be a barrier to getting help. With the support of the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), the CCWR has been able to provide counselling sessions free of charge via telephone or video chat for the past couple of weeks, up to April 5th, 2020. 

As the need continues to increase, we are reaching out for community support to be able to continue providing funded counselling sessions for those who need it most.","$20,000.00","The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region consists of the following counselling agencies: Carizon Family and Community Services, Family Counselling Centre of Cambridge and North Dumfries, KW Counselling Services, Interfaith Community Counselling Centre, Shalom Counselling Services and Woolwich Counselling Centre. 

The Collaborative has shared a long-standing partnership, capitalizing on strong collaboration, unique strengths and the mutual vision of a system where referrals to counselling are smooth, seamless and straightforward. The services provided are available to everyone and the infrastructure required to support the system is both efficient and robust. Working together, the Collaborative has been able to put together the framework for centralized access to counselling services to ensure a single point of contact, integrate services, and provide person-centred and effective support to those in our community. 

The Collaborative is committed to continue providing mental health services to those who need it now more than ever during this challenging and uncertain time. Counselling is a key component of the continuum of mental health supports and we are seeking funding to continue providing funded counselling sessions to address these demands and stressors and provide a sense of stability for those impacted by mental health challenges that are increasing during the social isolation period.

Our Counselling teams have gone through a complete service transformation to keep staff and individuals safe and healthy. We are supporting people in new ways such as individual phone or video sessions. Counselling appointments are being offered at flexible times and individuals struggling can simply call a Central Intake number to connect with the right service. 

The Collaborative capacity, professional experience and diversified services allow us to support the needs of the community and provide the tools that will support them stay mentally healthy. We recognize the importance to support individuals during this time as it will help prevent emergency services and the mental health system from additional stress and pressure. By working with our clients, we are not just putting a Band-Aid on an identified need; instead, we help change their perspectives and guide them as they take concrete steps to move forward.  There is an enormous body of literature that demonstrates the clinical and cost effectiveness of counselling for mental health issues. The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region (CCWR), offers proven interventions that allow participants to harness their strengths, gain new insights and skills and increase resilience.

","Making mental health a priority is the tag line for The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region partners. 100% of the funding we are requesting is going to support the work provided by the six counselling partners of the Collaborative, to provide funded counselling services  and to help support the people who are struggling with feelings of anxiety, depression, isolation and others due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

As mentioned before, our teams have developed the capacity and have been able to provide funded counselling sessions up to and including April 5th, 2020. As the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve, we recognize that the mental health supports in our communities are needed more than ever, as more individuals and families struggle with their finances among the other stressors added by this pandemic and its uncertainty. Offering funded counselling services means clients do not have to wait or be concerned about the financial barriers and will be able to address their concerns before they turn into a full-blown crisis. Supporting an individual’s mental health is key during this time and all of the funds requested will support the health, wellness and safety of our staff members and individuals and families in our community. 

As Carizon Family and Counselling Services is the centralized access to and for the organizations of the CCWR Collaborative, we are submitting this application submitting this application for this funding. The $100,000.00 we are requesting will support the six member organizations of the CCWR,  and will ensure that not only can we offer the mental health services that are greatly needed in our community, but it will also allow us the time to continue our efforts to raise the additional funds that will be required to continue the critical support our agencies provide.
","The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region completed a joint strategic planning initiative in 2018, which guides our work together. Our work is also supported by the strategy planning of each agency. This strategic planning also ensures the viability of the CCWR over the next 6 months and beyond.

Transforming the existing services to respond to isolation and social and physical distancing due to COVID-19 is an extension of the Collaborative services. The current infrastructure of the CCWR will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of offering counselling session through telephone and/or video conferencing as a new way to deliver services in the future in order to better respond to the needs of the community. 
",The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region 2018 strategic plan will be emailed to the address mentioned above.

As a member in the Commissioner’s COVID-19 Response Team, we coordinate with the ROW Community Support Services to fill a gap in services to this most vulnerable population. Within two weeks the meals we serve have doubled (60 to 110) and is growing. There is an increased need among the population in the downtown core; individuals with addictions and mental health issues are showing signs of extra stress.  Our front line workers are reporting comments of hunger, extreme anxiety, and confusion brought on by displacement within this vulnerable community.
We supply hand sanitizers, gloves, and masks not only to our team and volunteers but also to clients. We give bandages, wipes, and purchasing individual food packaging for extra hygiene vigilance.  
We are currently the only depot to schedule, package and deliver emergency food hampers in Cambridge, Kitchener, and Waterloo Region, to low income homes meeting the following criteria:
•	Too ill to leave their residence
•	Self-Isolation or mandated quarantine with no alternative ways to access programs
•	Individual(s)who rely on a primary caregiver for food and the caregiver is no longer available
•	Recent release from hospital and compromised immune systems
•	Mobility issues with underlying health conditions
 These expansions of our regular social services are vital in doing our part in containing the virus from spreading especially within the low income/ homeless population in the Waterloo Region. But also, we are servicing a new client, the elderly, the ill, and the isolated, people who through this pandemic are now reaching out for help accessing food.
","$20,000","Home Hamper Delivery: delivers to those challenged by low income barriers; self -isolation; mandatory quarantine; elderly immune; compromised; mobility challenges; etc.  This involves volunteer management of registration, booking, packing, and delivering. 
We collaborate with Waterloo Region Food Bank for food and Waterloo Region Family and Children’s Services for driving. We also use own two vehicles.  These activities include providing safety protocols and PPEs to every volunteer driver.
Our agency is located at 75 Tilley Drive, Kitchener, ON. Before the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, we occupied a third of the building, but since mid-March and suspension of church programming we are utilizing the whole building to receive, package, and prepare for this program. For instance, the large gymnasium of 5,000 square feet is currently our “Amazon “ type warehousing for the delivery part of the emergency food programing.  The building overhead now falls on our program.
Hot Meal Program:  This is an enhanced meal program that has been requested by the Waterloo Region Food Distribution Partners and meets a gap in meal services for the most vulnerable and the displaced homeless in Kitchener’s downtown core.  The core activities are volunteer management because  our regular elderly cooks are unable to continue which has put us in the position of quickly providing Food Safety Courses along with kitchen health and safety training for a new volunteer base.   In order to sustain the enhanced meal program, we need financial assistance in the following areas:
•	Training costs for Canada Food Safety Certification
•	COVID -19 specific training of PPE usage 
•	Catering of hot meal is what would be most helpful for nutritional and health needs of at risk population
•	Branding of our volunteers to quickly identify the team
•	Our aging vehicle that has become such a vital part of being able to provide these food services
•	Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) - to support each new helper.  We are in dire need of masks, goggles, gloves, hand sanitizer, 
We now solely rely on our kitchen at 75 Tillsley for all meal prep and our Emergency Disaster Vehicle desperately needs additional food warming capacity, single use packaging, emergency safety equipment for barricading, and telecommunication equipment for the safety of staff and volunteers. Most of our volunteers are client based, which requires additional computers for training in PPE use, COVID specific instruction, information, and extra cell phones for use during deployment.
The Emergency Hamper Program: Funding is necessary to keep an aging service vehicle operational to pick up donations, distribute  food and other necessities including medication pick up /delivery…We are noticing an increase in COVID19 specific barriers and challenges especially for the elderly, and mobility challenged. 
As a vital food distribution partner The Salvation Army is offering emergency food hampers for low income families in our community. This program is providing PPE for volunteers, and staff daily.
","As outline above we are requiring funds for specific training that includes the safe handling of food, non-crisis violence intervention and other emergency response measures. The use of webinars provided by our national organization is very helpful in this training, however, they require an infrastructure of computers in order for our redeployed staff and volunteers to access these webinars.

Secondly, The Salvation Army is also investing in a series of mental health webinars offered through our Employee Benefits program, again these also require computer access.

Thirdly, our vehicle that is used for pick-ups and food deliveries is very old and with the increased demand is requiring additional maintenance (leading to eventual replacement) for the safety of our staff and volunteer drivers.

Fourthly, we are requiring a considerable increase in cleaning supplies and equipment to minimize the contact with germs while serving the vulnerable populations. This includes face masks, gloves, hand sanitizers, and additional disinfecting cleaning supplies.


We are requesting 15% of our funding be used for our Kitchener-Waterloo ministry unit's contribution to the safety Webinars and the technology to run these for our staff and volunteers; and the necessary safety equipment.

We are requesting 25% of our funding be used for our program vehicle (this is a cross purpose linked with both safety and program delivery).","Firstly, we are in partnership with the Waterloo Region Food Bank to provide the food for our emergency and home delivery hampers. We are also in partnership with the Waterloo Region Family and Children's Services to assist with the transportation of home delivery hampers. The collaboration with both of these local partners helps ensure long term viability both fiscally (through shared resources) and through a shared volunteer base.

Secondly, we have adopted very strict financial restrictions that limits all of our expenses to our current COVID-19 response. These restrictions will exist beyond the current emergency response.

Thirdly, we are utilizing volunteers really well at this point which also helps our financial sustainability. While we are increasing wages to our front-line workers and some of them are receiving additional hours, the volunteers are a huge asset at this point.

Finally, we are a part of the larger Salvation Army network. This means we have their infrastructure support around webinars to help keep our staff and volunteers safe. We also have their infrastructure that provides backbone support in the area of fiscal management and human resources

4/8/2020 15:16:43,Bereaved Families of Ontario - Midwestern Region,871593117 RR0001,Jaime Bickerton,jaime@bfomidwest.org,,,"65 Hanson Avenue, Kitchener ON  N2C 2H6",https://bfomidwest.org/,"The urgent need addressed by this application is Bereaved Families of Ontario – Midwestern Region’s (BFO-MR) ability to create community and support individuals who are grieving during a time when traditional ways of honouring our loved ones and seeking support are greatly impacted by the pandemic.

While BFO-MR focuses on supporting families when a death has occurred, what we are all experiencing right now IS grief. We are collectively mourning the loss of the world as we know it.
 
Grief is already an isolating experience on its own. Fear and discomfort may affect a person’s ability and willingness to seek out support. Our work at BFO-MR centres on creating a community of support so people don’t feel alone in their grief experience. The bereaved are among people who get it, because they have been there too. 

In our current environment, it is the actual physical inability to be with friends and family when a death occurs that is complicating the grief experience. It’s the inability to hold a funeral or memorial service; it’s the inability to connect with people who are going through a similar experience in a meaningful way; it’s the inability to share a hug that tells each other we’re in this together. This disconnection can make grief harder to process and lead to increased anxiety. 

There has never been a more critical time for us to have the capacity to provide peer support to people in our community who are grieving than right now. We are doing the work to provide as many supports online as possible, so that individuals who are grieving have somewhere to turn. 
","$16,000","We’re seeking funding to assist with staffing costs of our Program Coordinator. Her role is critical to our ability to continue providing service. Not only is she on the front lines working directly with community members looking for programming, she has also stepped into a support role in recent weeks, co-facilitating our virtual mixed-loss groups and filling gaps volunteers have so far been unable to fulfill.

These activities enhance our current service delivery as we’ve been working towards transitioning all programming (with the exception of children and teen groups) over to virtual. Activities include:

• Creation of new policies, procedures and group guidelines for virtual supports to ensure we’re offering them in a safe and responsible way.

• Coordination of our virtual Living with Loss Groups – LWL was traditionally offered in-person, once or twice/month in Kitchener, Cambridge, Guelph and Mount Forest, and we offered a group specifically for adults grieving a death by substance use. We’ve combined all of these groups into one LWL Virtual Group now being offered weekly in the month of April. We’re working towards doing the same in May (and potentially longer as the situation dictates).

• Coordination of our closed groups for parents grieving the death of an infant or child –includes conducting virtual intakes, modifying our program manuals to support the virtual format, ongoing communication with group participants and debriefing with volunteer facilitators.

• Volunteer training – We have a solid base of volunteer facilitators who traditionally lead our peer support groups, however we're recognizing there is a level of discomfort with the technology aspect of running a group virtually. As such, we aren’t getting as much participation as we would typically see. Greater engagement is required so we can train them, ease any concerns and ensure programming can continue.

Given there is so much uncertainty regarding how long we’re going to be in isolation, we are also starting to think about the impact this will have on the memorial events we run in September and November. We’re already looking at how we might be able to continue to create a space for individuals who are grieving to honour loved ones in a meaningful way. Our program coordinator is also heavily involved in this aspect of the services we provide.

All of these activities are taking place while our team of three works from home. Given the virtual nature of our supports now, they are accessible to a broader audience, which in the past was typically limited to geography. They are still offered free of charge.

We anticipate being able to take advantage of the wage subsidy program being offered through the government. Our golf tournament (scheduled for May and budgeted to bring in over $19,000 during March, April and May) has been pushed to September, with no assurances it will run at all. We receive monthly funding through bingo and quarterly funds through Nevada sales, which are now both cancelled indefinitely. We also cancelled our April fundraising book sale.","We are fortunate in that the direction we have taken so we can continue service has meant that our staff and volunteers can remain isolated and safe at home. 

• All staff can effectively and efficiently do their jobs from home – this is mandated. Our Program Coordinator, Outreach Coordinator and ED all have BFO-issued laptops. Any files we need to access are stored electronically via Office 365/SharePoint and contact information for members, volunteers, donors, etc., via Sumac, our cloud-based database system. 

• Greater flexibility in what the workday looks like is being encouraged and celebrated – given the type of work we do, this has always been a policy at BFO-MR in support of our staff’s mental health and wellness, but it is being encouraged even more so now. We are encouraging staff to take the breaks they need when they need them, and we’re not enforcing specific “office” hours. As a small team, we can only succeed when we trust and support each other, and we are fortunate to have an exceptionally strong team at BFO-MR. 

• Providing access to platforms like Zoom to run our grief support programs and allow for face-to-face interactions among staff and volunteers. We will potentially be complementing Zoom with Microsoft Teams to facilitate real-time, ongoing communications. We have also made our paid Zoom account available to staff so they can connect with friends and loved ones when they need to. 

• Providing group materials electronically. Previously, any group resources (i.e. program manuals, articles, additional resources) were provided in hard copy format to members and facilitators during the course of group. We are now offering them digitally and providing the option to mail group materials if members still want hard copies and they don’t have access to a printer. 

• Ongoing check-in communications with staff members including starting each day with gratitude emails, more frequent phone calls to talk things through and connect personally, and weekly Zoom meetings with staff. We are also planning all-facilitator meeting with all of our volunteers to check in with everyone to see how they are managing and to give those who have facilitated virtually a chance to share their experiences. 

In our opinion, each of these elements are non-negotiable moving forward in this environment and are becoming a part of what we do every day – our new “business as usual”. As such, we will be honest; it is difficult to allocate a precise percentage of our requested funding to these tasks. Conservatively, we would estimate 25-35%. 
","The Executive Director and BFO-MR Board are currently going through the exercise of scenario planning, looking at the impacts of the pandemic at three, six and 12-month intervals. Following the creation of these scenarios, we are developing plans to address revenue shortfalls so we can mitigate the risks of service interruption.

Our immediate actions have included:
• Conversations with our funders and major donors so they are aware of the current situation’s impact on our ability to provide service.
• Eliminating any expenses not deemed essential to our operations. 
• Examining ways to lower our fixed costs – at this point, we do not need to lay off employees, but realize we may have to look at reducing hours for all staff so that we can continue to support.
• Deferring our golf tournament (biggest fundraiser of the year) to maximize potential profits down the road. Pushing this event out to September will also give us time and space should we need to revisit. 
• Lots of learning with regard to fundraising best practices in the current environment. We will be revisiting our fundraising strategy to identify what campaigns or initiatives can be expedited, including a planned monthly giving program. 

At this time, we have not initiated any new partnerships to support service continuity, as we first had to identify our approach to keep moving forward. We have an existing joint initiative agreement with Hummingbird Centre for Hope to deliver grief support programming for teens, so we will continue to work together to identify how we will move this program forward. We will also continue conversations with them to gauge if there are other areas where it would make sense for us to work together. 

In addition, Bereaved Families of Ontario – Midwestern Region is participating in a working group to support the Region of Waterloo’s pandemic response. We are specifically providing knowledge and expertise in the areas of grief and bereavement support and are helping to create resources for the community. We anticipate that, through our involvement in this initiative, other opportunities for partnership and engagement with organizations will come about.

As a result of covid-19, we have had to scale back operations (we have always been open 24/7) in order to focus our supports and staffing on the youth who access our co-ed shelter - these being the most vulnerable to lower immunity and no place to self isolate if symptoms occur.  We have opened ourselves up to 24/7 services to this cohort which has increased our food costs, the need for PPE's, entertainment (not all youth want to stay on site all day) and in terms of staff retention (some quit, some sick, etc).  We are also operating, at the Region's request, an overflow shelter for youth who cannot access regular shelter beds.  This overflow serves the highest acuity youth (mental health, addictions, violent behavour) and are attempting to keep them on site as well and assessing all who come to us for covid-like symptoms. ",20000,"Core activities would include front line staff back filling (when staff are ill), wellness equipment (thermometers, masks for youth and staff, cleaning supplies), entertainment (to encourage youth to stay on site during the day - especially with nicer weather coming - to ensure they don't spread or pick up covid) such as video games, board games, art supplies, etc., administrative overhead and additional leadership staff on site for supervision. We are hoping to take advantage of the wage subsidy, but funds are needed now as staff fall ill and volunteers are non-existent during this time.  Our agency relies heavily on community funding and local grants - much of which has fallen off as no 3rd party events are happening and our usual active fund raising efforts are on hold","100% of the funding will be dedicated to wellness - that of staff and clients.  Additional incentives to staff to work and youth to remain on site are needed.  Clients are requesting masks for themselves, staff are requesting additional cleaning occur - our latest quote for daily cleaning is $3300/month; laundry expenditures have also increased as linen has now been moved offsite to ensure cleanliness.",We continue to partner with the Region of Waterloo and the Shelter Network.  We have also developed a new partnership with the Inner City Health Alliance to ensure proper screening and safety precautions are in place to keep folks healthy.  An isolation floor at the Radison has been made available to any who are symptomatic and we have had to send 2 youth there thus far - both returned negative for covid.  We are reaching out to granting bodies who have funding available for covid as we are deemed an essential service.  We are also negotiating with the various levels of government to operate 24/7 in light of this pandemic with a focus on our shelter youth only.,

The Pregnancy Centre serves at-risk single moms in this community who depend on us for emotional, physical and social supports.  In 2019 we had 1307 visits to our centre by women in need of Pregnancy Tests, Options Counselling and Supportive Resources and Programming.  Our supportive programming includes Prenatal Classes, Care Closet (diapers, wipes, formula and clothing) as well as a weekly Mom to Mom support group for single moms.   Over 40 women attended our weekly Mom to Mom program in 2019.  At this program single moms engage in weekly lessons about parenting, healthy relationships, budgeting, health and nutrition and self-care.  Each single moms receives a trained mentor to offer support while at the program and monthly in the community at a activity chosen by the client.  As you can see, the women we support benefit from face-to-face care and support.  During COVID-19 our methods have had to change but our commitment to support has not.  In isolation, the women we serve struggle with anxiety and many are overwhelmed and alone with small children.  These women depend on being able to drop-in to our centre, engage in our community and benefit from supportive programs.  Without these services, many are struggling.","$20, 000","We are seeking funding to enable our staff team to mobilize our Care Closet to allow clients to still receive needed supplies delivered to their homes.  Most of the supplies in our Care Closet are donated by the community.  We are limited in our ability to take donations at this time due to physical distancing and the closure of our centre to the public. We are still in need of diapers, wipes and formula.  We want to ensure that families who are in need do not go without these needed resources.   Generous members of the community are providing ""porch pick-ups"" (donations left on their porch for us to pick-up)  but the demand is very high. This funding will allow us to keep our stock of diapers, wipes and formula up and cover the travel expenses of delivering these items to clients through the Region of Waterloo.  We also want to provide Protective Safety Gear to anyone making deliveries ensuring that all staff, volunteers and clients are safe.  Donations require disinfecting and careful handling  to ensure the health and safety of all involved.   For our Mom to Mom program we have moved to Facebook Live events and group chats.  Many of the moms have reported anxiety and depression while in isolation.  With additional funding, we will be able to have a counselor provide Facebook Live sessions on how to manage in isolation.  We plan to deliver pantry items and craft supplies to the single moms so that they can participate in an interactive Facebook Live demonstrations.  Additional funding will provide the supplies needed to do this and result in single moms feeling that they still have social connections and encouragement to engage with their children in healthy ways.  We have had to move our offices into our homes while still ensuring that clients can reach us for the support they need.  There have been increased cell phone costs and set-up for remote access to our client data base.  Prior to COVID-19, we were about to complete a hire for a Client Services Director.  Having a gap in this role has had a critical impact on our centre since COVID-19.  A Client Services director is an incredibly critical role as they manage and lead the many supportive services offered to our clients as well provide regular check-in's with clients.  Due to the increased costs of setting up remotely, the potential loss in revenue and the uncertain future, our small staff team is covering this role.  We would like to proceed with a part-time hire which allows for more sustainable support to this vulnerable population of women.  As a key resource to women in unexpected pregnancy, we want to ensure that all single women in the community can access the supports they need.  ","Our staff and volunteers will be delivering packages of supplies to clients.  Everyone who participates will be required to have protective gear, adequate disinfecting wipes and complete a Healthy Volunteer Screen.  Allowing staff members to work from home has provided safety and wellness for them and their families, but has required additional computer equipment and cell phone usage costs.   Paying a counselor to provide e-counselling to the Mom to Mom clients is critical to their emotional and mental health. ","In collaboration with the board, The Pregnancy Centre has put a hold on all plans for expansion.   Our intent was to acquire a larger facility for program expansion this spring. Unless we acquire additional funding, we will not proceed will filling the Client Services Director role. We feel confident that these changes in our plans will allow us to remain open with online, telephone and remote support to clients.   We are in collaboration with abortion providers and adoption agencies to ensure that we are giving clients the most up-to-date information about abortion clinics and hospital services in light of the COVID-19.

4/8/2020 17:36:04,KW Counselling Services,130538614RR0001,Rebecca Wwebb,rwebb@kwcounselling.com,,,"480 Charles Street East Kitchener, ON N2G 4K5",http://www.kwcounselling.com,"The unprecedented experiences and implications of this pandemic have profound effects on mental health.

The emotional effects of the pandemic are far-reaching and we have yet to see their full ramifications.  Everyone is experiencing added stressors to their lives; some people are working the front lines, some are adapting to working from home, others have been laid off, some have lost someone to this pandemic, others worry about their own health or the health of loved ones, and many more are experiencing a sense of heightened anxiety. 

It is increasingly important to ensure that everyone gets the mental health support they need to avoid increased demands for intensive treatment and further strain on police and hospital services. Those currently struggling with mental health and addictions challenges, older adults and seniors, and LGBTQ2+ youth are particularly vulnerable.

At a time of great uncertainty and anxiety, we are working with our partners in the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region (CCWR) to lessen the financial stress of accessing services.  We believe that cost should never be a barrier to getting help. With the support of the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), the CCWR has been able to provide counselling sessions free of charge via telephone or video chat for the past couple of weeks, up to April 5, 2020. 

As the need continues to increase, we are reaching out for community support to be able to continue providing funded counselling sessions for those who need it most.
",20000,"We are seeking funding to help us continue to offer no cost or subsidized counselling services via phone or video to people in Waterloo Region.

This year, KW Counselling Services celebrates 70 years of providing excellent counselling services here in Waterloo Region. Since the state of emergency was declared in Ontario, we have cancelled all of our face to face counselling, groups, and events in favour of counselling via phone and video. Thanks to partners like KW Community Foundation, the Astley Family Foundation, and the Ontario Trillium Foundation, we already have experience with offering online video counselling. We have been using a platform called OnCall Health and several of our counsellors are already trained and licenced.

These services will be offered by our existing staff, working remotely. They are an expansion of existing service to meet the escalated need in the community. Now that we have been able to stand these services up, and our staff have gained experience in them, we will be able to serve more clients than we did with our initial LHIN-funded program.

Counselling can help address the demands and stressors related to COVID-19, and provide a sense of stability for those impacted by mental health challenges that might be exacerbated during this period of social isolation. There is an enormous body of literature that demonstrates the clinical and cost effectiveness of counselling for mental health issues.

We know that providing access to counselling services is especially crucial during this time as it will help prevent hospitals and emergency services from additional stress and pressure. By working with our clients, we are not just putting a Band-Aid on an identified need; instead, we help change their perspectives and guide them as they take concrete steps to move forward.  KW Counselling Services provides proven interventions that allow participants to harness their strengths, gain new insights and skills, and increase resilience.

As mentioned above, we have developed the capacity and have been able to provide funded counselling sessions up to and including April 5, 2020. As the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve, we recognize that the mental health supports in our communities are needed more than ever, as more individuals and families struggle with their finances in combination with the other stressors caused by this pandemic and its uncertainty. Offering funded counselling services means clients do not have to wait or be concerned about the financial barriers to service, and will be able to address their concerns in their time of need. 
","Making mental health a priority is crucial. This applies both to our staff and the people we serve. We recognize that our staff are also experiencing their own challenges related to the pandemic at this time and we are working to ensure that they are safe and well. Moving from face to face counselling services to phone and video service has been a unique challenge. To protect our staff, they are working remotely from their homes in order to maintain physical distancing. 

There are unique privacy and safety concerns to consider when offering virtual services – both for our clients and our counsellors. When a counsellor and client are not in the same room, the counsellor has to be prepared to respond to emergency situations from a distance. We have had to increase the amount of clinical supervision to our counsellors to help support them as they are working in isolation. Working from their homes, our counsellors are blending their work and personal lives in order to deliver this much needed service. Increased supervision is helping us to ensure our staff are maintaining safe “use of self” in their work.

While our staff are accustomed to building their therapeutic relationships in our office, building those relationships in their homes is an entirely different matter. We are working with staff to ensure they have safe, private spaces in their homes to do this work. We are also working to ensure that they are taking adequate breaks between sessions, and making their own wellness a priority. As much as 20% of the funds we are requesting will be allocated for this increased level of supervision.

This is difficult work for our staff, and our supervisors and Leadership Team are working hard to acknowledge that, and to dedicate resources towards ameliorating the challenges. Ensuring our staff are well, means that our no cost and subsidized phone and video counselling services will be up to our regular excellent standard, and our staff will be able to continue doing the work they love.
","We recognize that many people are focused on the immediate physical wellness and financial stability of their households at this time, and we anticipate an increased demand for service once the state of emergency has been lifted. KW Counselling Services is not only addressing the current needs for service, but is strategizing for how we might best meet the needs of the community going forward.

As noted above, KW Counselling Services has a 70-year history in our community. We are working to ensure the viability of the agency over the next six months and, for many years into the future.

Transforming our existing services, enabling us to work remotely and respect physical distancing due to COVID-19, has been a unique challenge, but we are proud of the work our staff have done thus far. Between March 24th and April 3rd, we completed 94 counselling sessions via phone or video with 75 unique clients. In addition, our counsellors did phone check ins with 230 clients; a total of 37.5 hours of service above the 94 sessions previously mentioned. As we always do, we will use client feedback to enhance and improve these new service offerings as we move forward.

Our work contributes to the mental and emotional health of these young people as they journey through the criminal justice process and beyond.
-Being involved in a police investigation or criminal court can understandably create anxiety and stress for young people and their caregivers.  They often have many questions as their matter progresses; among those, youth may not have supportive persons in their lives who can assist them in coping with the situation they are experiencing.  COVID-19 has added a higher level of stress and anxiety for many of our clients and their families.  
-Investigations are still taking place and charges are being laid.  Revenue is lost because of COVID-19.  We are considered an essential service.  In 2019-20, we supported over 1,500 young people, over 1,300 from Waterloo Region.  We currently have almost 600 active cases and many of those are needing updates as court cases are not currently being closed.  
-More than twice a day a young person finds the courage to tell someone that they have experienced abuse and more than 10 young people become a victim or witness of crime in our community each week, before COVID-19. Child abuse and crime is still happening, it’s just that young people don’t have an outlet (e.g. supportive teacher) to disclose as they are housebound.  
-We need overhead and staffing to ensure the health and wellbeing of our current clients and any new clients, along with the anticipated drastic increase in new referrals that will happen once social isolation measures are lifted.  
-Management is working harder than ever to ensure we can continue to deliver our services.
","$20,000","Our main activities are ensuring that children and their families feel informed, supported and included throughout both the investigation of abuse and the criminal court process.  
Due to COVID-19 all our services are being provided remotely and we are requesting funding to support the following activities:

Direct support enhancement:
- Providing additional supports to children and their caregivers in relation to supporting their mental health and wellbeing.
-Providing additional coping strategies to deal with any increased stress and anxiety.
-Assessment of each client to ensure individualized support.
-Enhanced communication due to the ever-changing status of their case.  For example, all court is starting June 1 and dates are being re-scheduled.  Staff must update clients on these changes, but with the landscape changing daily, so might these dates change.
-Providing updated resources that are still available and connecting them to those resources.  

Indirect new support:
-Management hours in reaching out to other service providers to assist in navigating for clients how services are being provided in the community and how clients can connect with services as seamlessly as possible; also considering that not all persons are able to connect virtually as services now being offered (i.e. no computer to do video counseling).

Overhead
-Enhanced IT support for setting up remote access, video conferencing, security measures for all our staff.  Tech support will be needed to assist in providing remote connection to Advocates during initial stage of the investigation.
-Communications support of monthly telephone bills for the agency and for front line staff.

Wellness of Staff
-Management providing additional supports and check-ins of their team.
-Providing daily or bi-weekly staff time for face time with their respective teams

New Capacity Building
-Management team working with the Board to determine how we will be able to handle the anticipated influx of new referrals when self-isolation restrictions are removed.  For some children, their home is not a safe or healthy place and we have to brace ourselves for an increase in referrals.  There are concerns about crimes involving children not being reported and when restrictions being lifted and court matters going forward, pressure on the direct client support and administration time to support this will be greatly impacted. 
-With fundraising down and lost revenue, management is working to determine how to continue to deliver the quality of service, and how to raise the necessary funds with the anticipated increase in referrals.

Some of the activities above relate to staffing costs and we are aware of the Federal Wage Subsidy Program, but this assistance may be weeks or months away.  We review the information as more details are provided and plan to pursue this option if or when we meet the criteria.
","We are requesting some funding to support the health, wellness and safety of our staff.  
Some of the activities include:
-Management is reaching out more often to their respective team members to ensure they are coping and handling the situation, both professionally and personally.
-Staff are devoting additional time for group meetings within their respective teams.  Zoom meetings are taking place a few times each week for check-ins, to help alleviate stress and assist staff, if struggling.
-Staff are devoting time to send inspiring pictures, notes to others, encouraging positivity and remain hopeful.
-The Executive Director is sending weekly updates to staff.
-The Executive Director has increased meeting with our volunteer Board, providing updates to help alleviate some of the stress and worry about the organization.
-Staff are reaching out to some of our key volunteers, providing updates, reassurances and assistance where needed.

The health and safety of our staff and volunteers are of utmost importance.  We anticipate that up to 25% of the funding we are requesting is dedicated to this. 
","-We have managed the Safe Hands, Strong Future campaign funds prudently. This has left us with approximately 6 months in reserve funds;
-We are closely monitoring cash flow;
-We are looking at creative ways to generate funding especially since approximately 80% of overall funding comes from community donors;
-We are looking at leveraging things like social media, both short and long-term;
-We have been assessing our donor base and communicating with donors;
-There has been a decrease in reporting of violence and abuse. There are not as many investigations in the CYAC and, because of the closing of the courts, this has impacted our CWP as well. However, we reasonably expect that this is merely the calm before the storm. Evidence from other countries is showing us that there has been a spike or surge in the number of domestic, intimate partner and family violence cases in the wake of the pandemic. Experts in Canada expect the same and, as a result, we expect that the demand for our services as the days, weeks and months pass will increase considerably and we need to be able to meet the demand for our services;
-We are working closely with our existing community partners (Family and Children’s Services; Waterloo Regional Police; Guelph Police; Ontario Provincial Police; Carizon) about the trends and need for services;
-We are exploring creative ways to evolve the delivery of our services to meet the needs of children and youth;
-We are prioritizing components of our service delivery to enable us to meet the expected increase in demand.

We particularly serve members with
cancer who are immunocompromised due to chemotherapy and sometimes radiation.
Because many cancers are age-related, a number of our members are over 70 years old.
HopeSpring has cancer counselling, ovarian support group, caregivers, men, and women
groups. We also have gentle exercise, which is an important recommendation for those affected by cancer. The various programs provide information, psycho social counselling, care, and reduce isolation. Even before COVID-19, cancer patients could end up in isolation with low blood counts, pain, and impaired mobility in cases where surgery has occurred. Depending on their treatment, they can go out from time to time. Now they are completely isolated because they cannot go out at all due to the danger of COVID-19. To help our members, we have changed most of our programs to work virtually. People can access counselling, support groups, and gentle exercise by Zoom or phone. Wigs, post-surgery breast cancer camisoles, and fabric caps are delivered to the door of members and left to prevent contact. All staff and facilitators are working remotely. These changes have reduced member isolation and enabled those affected by cancer to access counselling and support groups. HopeSpring is an essential social service. It has been noted by our staff that counselling and group sessions end up covering concerns with COVID-19.
","$16,765.55","HopeSpring staff are now working remotely. All appointments, accounting, communications,
and administration are covered by HopeSpring laptops and the use of staff personal internet
and phones. With Zoom and phone we are now offering the following enhanced services:
(1) Cancer care counselling (can also include grief)
(2) Support groups for ovarian cancer, women, men, caregivers
(3) Gentle exercise – mediation, Tai Chi, yoga, Qi Gong
(4) After the end of the pandemic, some of these programs, for instance, counselling, will go
back to regular appointments. We will also continue Zoom and phone appointments for
those affected by cancer who will need to be in isolation due to their compromised immune
system or fatigue.
(5) Presently, cancer patients can also order a post breast cancer surgery camisole, wig, or
fabric cap.
(6) The camisole, wig, or fabric cap is delivered to the person’s door and left there for them with no contact.
(7) Relaxation therapies like massage therapy have been postponed until the end of the
pandemic as they involve one on one interaction and touching and are a risk at this time.","All staff and volunteers are working remotely using laptops, zoom, Office365 licenses, Cloud storage, additional back-ups through our third party IT Support provider,  and a database upgrade of Sumac to the cloud. These had to be purchased as we only had CPUs and desktop versions of software prior to the pandemic. The Board made the decision to quickly mobilize remote agile strategies and purchase equipment so we are able to continue serving our members.  47% our our funding request is to offset the sunk costs of this technology upgrade. To ensure the sustainability of HopeSpring, the Board has also approved a temporary increase of 20 hours per week for two part time staff and this time is dedicated solely to grant writing to replace revenues that we will not receive given major fund raising events have been cancelled due to COVID-19. This additional labour cost is anticipated for about two months and represents 28% of the funding we have requested.  ","We are not in discussion with any organization, although we do have partners such as InterFaith Counselling, Waterloo Wellington Self-management, Look Good Feel Better. We work closely with the Grand River Cancer Centre. HopeSpring is totally funded by donations, grants and fundraising. We do not get any government funding. Because of a large drop in donations and the cancellation of third party events and gala, we are putting together a plan to increase individual and monthly donors and to apply for 4-5 times the usual number of grants that we are able to process when we are managing support groups in-person. We presently have an online fundraiser asking for up to 10,000 dollars to fund our counsellor. Two staff are working half time on grant applications. We are applying to the federal government for the 75% wage subsidy. Our organization will remain agile and we will reassess staff support and project assignments on a regular basis to distribute the workload.  Our key focus is on sourcing and providing on-line Member Care and fundraising initiatives and execution. It is imperative during this critical time that we finding funding to replace lost revenue streams given fund raisers, donor cultivation, and a major gala cannot be held. We are working on building our presence on-line and in the community by building partnerships with on-line service providers and program providers locally, regionally, provincially and nationally; while also initiating a website redesign RFP. We are also reviewing procedures to identify continuous improvements that can be made to eliminate low value steps, duplication and reduce the cycle time for operational and finance tasks. This entails a time study of our resource allocation and Gemba challenges to critically assess our procedures.",Will send an email of our draft strategic plan and community conversations report.

N2L 6C7",http://adventure4change.org,"Adventure4Change works to support children, youth, and families in low-income and marginalized communities in North Waterloo. These communities were considered vulnerable before this pandemic because of economic disparity, trauma histories that come from life as a refugee or life experiencing generational poverty, high levels of mental health concerns, and for some, unstable and overcrowded housing. According to Alliance for Child Protection in Humanitarian Action, “Children and families who are already vulnerable due to socio-economic exclusion or those who live in overcrowded settings are particularly at risk” when we are facing a crisis like this pandemic (2019b: 2). After conversations with community partners (The House of Friendship, WRDSB, and FACS), as well as many phone calls to residents in our community we have gathered information that tells a story of impending crisis in the homes of our resident families. From our community partners we hear the concern that echoes the literature that says “[d]isruptions to families, friendships and the wider community can have detrimental consequences for children’s well-being, development and their protection” (Fischer, Elliott and Bertrand, 2018: 9-11). From parents and youth we hear concerns of growing tension in homes, mental health concerns bubbling to the surface, boredom that leads to unhealthy and destructive behaviours, and crippling and isolating fear. 
With  all of the local community supports in our neighbourhood closed, our families need help. Parents need access to peer relationships; youth and children need access to healthy programming, opportunities to connect with friends and mentors, and ways to stay physically active; families need access to practical supports. As a team that has been active in our community for 15 years, we are well positioned to create online supports and networks to respond to the growing mental health and practical resource needs in our community.
","$20,000","With this funding we will hire a temporary part-time staff person to increase our capacity to respond to the needs of our community during this crisis. With extra capacity, we will be able to implement virtual programming and supports for our community to respond to the unique mental health needs that this crisis presents.
The tasks we aim to achieve with this grant include: 
Task 1: Assess needs of community: 
- In collaboration with The Resilience Project at Family and Children’s services, we will be conducting support phone calls to families to check in on our residents’ health, mental health, and needs. We will use a guided questionnaire developed by Family and Children’s Services to ensure that we are gathering pertinent information to inform our community support.
 
Task 2: Create Response Network of Volunteers
- We will continue our collaboration with our local schools to support child and youth learning at home. Through partnerships with local churches and community volunteers, we will create a response network of volunteers to engage in activities such as online tutoring, ensuring that students have the learning materials they need etc. 
- As far as we know, there are no other organizations who are currently focussed on the wellbeing of the youth in our community. We will facilitate connections between volunteers and resources from our own community, but also from the broader region.
Task 3: Launch Online Community of Connection
- Online connect opportunities for youth. We know that loneliness and isolation are causing anxiety and depression right now. We will provide regular times for youth to meet online to engage in healthy peer-support as well as in active programming such as at-home soccer training, art, yoga, etc.
- With the extra capacity that this new position will bring, we will train volunteers (many of whom were already invested in this community before the pandemic) to continue to engage with youth and families in a way that is appropriate in the current situation. This will allow us to monitor families and youth for emerging needs, risks, and warning signs and will allow us to continue to build supportive relationships for intervention and support. 
- As stay home orders persist and tensions rise in families, we will provide times for online meet ups for parents. This will create space for parents to encourage and support one another, as well as a place to ask questions, get information, and share ideas.
","With this funding we will hire a staff person to lead us in our online efforts. By doing so, we will be able to keep our staff, volunteers, and community safe by engaging from the safe distance that technology provides. We at Adventure4Change are in a unique position as brokers of volunteers and community involvement. Regularly we identify, recruit, train, and support volunteers as they step into meaningful engagement in community. We know from community and volunteer feedback, that the ways in which our volunteers are able to engage our community - through mentoring youth, tutoring children, building relationships with parents, facilitating activities etc. - is beneficial and purposeful for both volunteers and community members. By creating online connections in this time of isolation, we will support the mental health and wellness of our staff, volunteers, and community members by facilitating ongoing connection of meaningful relationships. In a time where many are isolated at home, being able to connect with community and to help others can provide a sense of purpose and value.
As always, we will continue to have (now virtual) regular team meetings. We do so twice per week to ensure that everyone is supported, encouraged, and resourced in these very unprecedented times. In these meetings we are able to look out for the health and wellbeing of all of our staff members. Regular meetings with volunteers also allow us to support them as they navigate not only involvement in our programs, but their own contexts and the uncertainty that is on all of our minds. 
Finally, we regularly participate around the table of the Resilience Project. These times allow us to collaborate and share ideas with other organizations in the area who are also supporting children, youth, and families. This ensures that we are all using best and healthy practices. These times allow us to check our programming ideas to make sure we are informed by resilience theory, to hear what activities have been the most beneficial for others, and to help us remain encouraged and motivated.
","There is no question that this virus has caused a massive disruption in our work and has served to hinder many very important and growing funding initiatives. We are a grassroots startup and we have repeatedly learned the value of adjusting to the changing circumstances and staying focused on our ultimate goals and purposes. The success of A4C lies in community involvement. We know that our impact will be sustainable as we continue to recruit and train community volunteers, and invite community into leadership. Through our sustained efforts to remain in meaningful contact with our community members, we will continue to build our sustainability.
Our primary concern is that we anticipate and take the steps forward that will lead to the great growth and vitality of our youth and their families. 
Cultivating key partnerships: Waterloo Board of Ed., Resilience Centre, City of Waterloo. We are exploring ways that our efforts will serve as a catalyst to other organizations that have a similar vested interest. For example, the City of Waterloo continues to work more closely with us to address the needs of teens. We collaborate with the Board of Ed. to more effectively and holistically address concerns.
We have made a plan to limit costs and expenses through an increased partnership with the City of Waterloo to secure a less expensive and more useful space.
We have spent many years investing heavily, we are now using this period of time to evaluate our activities, identify our core practices, and to consolidate our efforts. We have begun to assess our programs and identify those that best achieve our purposes and goals. 
We have begun - and will continue - to build partnerships with key community leaders and businesses. These partnerships will allow these leaders to contribute both their finances and expertise. 
In the fall we released a publication of research about our core programming in partnership with Wilfrid Laurier University to enhance credibility and reputation in the funding and business community.  We currently have a second publication underway, and intend to continue to share and publish stories of growth and change.
After 4 years of growth, we are carefully considering which of our programs our core initiatives are. Based on the financial picture and the needs that appear post-virus, we will consider retracting our level of engagement for a season to the very essentials. We are very aware of the fact that it will not be business as usual. We will be keen to enter into important dialogues with partners (The Resilience Project, the WRDSB, House of Friendship) to determine overall priorities. The importance of organizational viability will have to be considered beside the priorities of the community and in what ways these are best addressed. The fact that we are grassroots means that we will stay engaged with the community and endeavour to address issues in a collaborative fashion with important stakeholders.

4/9/2020 10:53:25,Marillac Place,138942156 RR0001,Tammy Northam,tnortham@marillacplace.ca,same,,"109 Young St., Kitchener, ON N2H 4Z2",https://marillacplace.ca/,"Marillac Place offers housing to independent young women ages sixteen and up who are pregnant or who have their child(ren) in their care, or who are attempting to regain care of their child(ren). Most of the women who come to us are homeless or lack resources to live independently.  There are some brand new babies coming into the house in the coming weeks who will not yet have their immunizations and so will need even greater protection from COVID-19.

Our vision is to provide not only a safe home for women and their children but to empower them to become economically self-sufficient, responsible adults. Participants receive support, guidance and information to make informed choices, gain insights, establish and attain educational and employment goals, acquire life skills and be actively involved in programming to achieve personal growth and parenting skills. 

 Since the COVID-19 pandemic has started new and necessary procedures and policies have been implemented.  Front line staff have been required to shift their focus from support, programming and rehabilitation to safe preparation of food, intense cleaning routines, social distancing and monitoring the safety practices and health status of participants as the priority.

Many of the women who reside with us are experiencing mental health issues and require significant social and emotional supports. Additionally, they are concerned about their own health and that of their children.  A few of the women are expecting and are anxious about going to the hospital during this time. The pandemic is adding more burden and mental health challenges to the women we serve through limiting their activities and increasing their isolation. The board and staff are deeply concerned about having enough funds to operate through this pandemic and into 2021.
","$20,000","Marillac receives about 1/3 of its funding from the Region of Waterloo and must raise the rest of the monies needed to operate from fundraising efforts.  These include the Spring Baby Bottle appeal which takes place in churches, running bingos, community grants, service club donations and an end of year direct mail.

We anticipate funds from these sources to be down significantly over the next nine months which means we will be short as much as $100,000-$180,000 in our overall $593,000 budget.  About 85% percent of the budgeted expenses for the year are for either front line staffing who work in the house or household operations.

We hope to be able to take advantage of the wage subsidy and if the maximum is received it could amount to as much as $68,000 (we are not able to confirm our eligibility at this time) but we will still have a significant shortfall for the year to cover essentials.

In a year Marillac Place spends $23,000 on groceries and consumable household products over and above what is provided by the Food Bank of Waterloo Region.  We also spend about $60,000 on operating the house (utilities, snow removal, repairs etc).  
","We are asking United Way Community Response Fund to provide funding support for essentials during this challenging time. Support in the amount of $20,000 would go along way and cover the basics for about a three-month window. We anticipate this number will be even higher this year as we are focusing on buying individually portioned food which is more expensive and more cleaning supplies.

Marillac Place is single staffing (ie staff are working one at a time).  When the staff person leaves the office to cook the women and children are not permitted in the area.  The women then proceed to come down in shifts to receive their food, clean up and return to their rooms.  Other than preparing food single-handedly, the staff are focusing on a stringent cleaning routine and keeping the participants safe.

100% of the funding from United Way Emergency Response Funds would go towards feeding the families we house and for cleaning and maintaining the residence.
","Here are some of the measures taking the following measures at Marillac Place to ensure the viability of the organization:

1.	Developing a revised pandemic budget to determine possible funding scenarios, sources and contingency plans
2.	Conducting a virtual Baby Bottle fundraising Campaign (normally occurs in churches) between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day.  Will consist of direct mail and an online component
3.	Applying for the wage subsidies available through the federal government to the extent possible
4.	Working with the Waterloo Region Food Bank to receive food donations (individual meals)
5.	Applying to foundations to access funding for necessary operations
6.	Participating on the weekly Region of Waterloo Housing Stability System conference calls
7.	Staying updated on Public Health notices/information federally, provincially and regionally
8.	Participating on Region of Waterloo Pandemic Housing Working Group
9.	Working with Family and Children Services to help ensure the safety of the participants
10.	Marillac Place weekly pandemic virtual staff meeting to discuss issues of urgent concern
11.	Developing internal policies to react to current pandemic
12.	Hosting monthly virtual board meetings; regular and emergency communication with Board of Directors

It is remarkable to see how the staff and board have pulled together to react to the current pandemic as efficiently and proactively as possible. We are fighting to provide safe housing for some of our community’s most vulnerable youth and young women during unprecedented times. 

Marillac Place is thankful for the United Way of Waterloo Region and your collaborative efforts with all the community donors and partners who are coming forward so quickly with the Community Response Fund to meet the urgent needs of those most vulnerable in Waterloo Region.",
4/9/2020 10:56:41,Reception House Waterloo Region,840337653RR0001,Carl Cadogan,carl@receptionhouse.ca,Kathie Must,kathie@receptionhouse.ca,"675 Queen St South, Suite 201, Kit, N2M 1A1",https://receptionhouse.ca/,"Reception House Waterloo Region (RHWR) supports the welcoming and integration of government assisted refugees (GARs). GARs are particularly vulnerable to marginalization, with consistently lower language, education level and existing social connections than claimants or privately sponsored refugees.   We welcome them, help them find housing, assist them as they heal from trauma and loss, ensure access to services such as health care and language classes and support them as they search for work or further education.  Almost all newcomers welcomed at RHWR are from racialized communities and/or religious minorities. They experience immense obstacles and inequities in every aspect of community life – competing in the housing market, finding work, accessing community services.  Even in “normal times”, navigating our complex community system, accessing needed services, and breaking down isolation are huge challenges. Today this is even more so. 

Today GARS face double isolation. Imagine arriving in a strange country without the language, acutely aware of a crisis and the outpouring of urgent messages that you cannot understand. Your family may be healing from trauma with severe (non-COVID) medical and mental health needs. Health services are closed. Virtual resources are primarily available only in English. Learning to get about in the community, find food, and access community services is on hold. You and your family are alone, intensely isolated, confused, frightened, and highly vulnerable.

We established a triage response and have worked closely with other service providers to deliver coordinated response plans.  We have adapted service delivery for social distancing, using phone check-ins and virtual tools wherever possible (but without tech expertise).  The increased service gaps have a devastating impact on our clients. We work to navigate, strategize alternatives and find practical solutions. Volunteers are a part of our circle of care and anxious to co-develop approaches for social integration. 
","$20,000"," Core Activities for funding include:

1/ IT SUPPORT to help build our capacity to do remote work effectively 
·         WHO -  All staff.  Our services delivery model is now largely virtual with very limited service offered face-to-face.  Many staff are working 100% remotely from home. Our telephone system and our technology architecture are designed to support core work done in the office locations, with work from home only as a complement.  That is not how we are working now, or how we see working in the foreseeable future.  We have made some immediate adjustments, but significant challenges remain. Additionally, we are exploring ways we can introduce remote tools into our social integration initiatives – The New Canadian Youth Connection Homework Club, English Outreach, and the Family Partnership Program. Our volunteers are key players in the circle of care.
·         WHERE – across the community
·         NEW – we currently have no dedicated IT resource.  

2/ CAPACITY BUILDING -  interpretation and translation services 
·         WHO – Communications from many sources are increasingly complex, urgent and rapid.  Most, if not all, are only in French and English.  Very limited messaging is available in multiple languages, and where it is, there is often a lengthy delay. The information that our clients need to know is increasing exponentially.  While our Case Managers regularly check in with clients in their language to ensure understanding, they need key resources and tools in the languages our clients use. Additionally, working remotely and in coordinating response plans presents additional interpretation needs.
·         WHERE -  For staff and clients across the community
·         ENHANCED – We have some internal ability to translate and interpret, and rely on the services of KW Multicultural Centre. However, the needs are quickly surpassing current capacity. Telephone interpretation services are increasingly being uses especially for language groups with no local, third party services available. 

3/ CAPACITY SUPPORT – an “immediate needs” fund 
·         WHO – Our staff work with clients to facilitate coordinated response plans, mitigate gaps and take practical steps as required. Social distancing and non-essential closures impact on what families are able to do and what services they are able to access, and how staff are able to assist them. The obstacles can be transportation, access to supplies and food, essential household goods, health treatments that are not covered by provincial or federal health coverage (OHIP/IFHP) etc.  The needs are acute and varied. 
·         WHERE - For clients in the community
·         NEW  
","Increasing the ability for our staff to support our clients virtually, be proactive, and stay in close virtual connection impacts dramatically on their ability to accomplish their work well. The impact of self-efficacy cannot be under-estimated on overall wellbeing. 

This can also impact dramatically on the wellbeing of our volunteers, who are a critical part of our circle of care. By strengthening virtual social integration in our youth and Family Partnership programs, we can engage our volunteers but within the safety of social distancing. By breaking down social isolation during these unprecedented times, we have the opportunity to positively impact the mental health of volunteers as well as clients. Both parties are in isolation. 

Moreover, RHWR staff are learning to work virtually and to do this well has an enormous wellness impact. To build the sense of “we are in this together” and trust in an uncertain world is the most substantive action we can take. 

We continue to provide orientation and support services to clients and that increased service delivery model has deepened our dependency on technology.
","Organizational viability is front and centre for the RHWR Board today, and in fact, sustainability has been a central focus of our strategic plan. Our strategy has incorporated community partnerships, innovative approaches to newcomer needs and funding diversity. Our core federal funding has provided a strong foundation for the work we do. As the regional provider of the federally funded Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP), the basic settlement support for government-assisted refugees, we have recently signed a five-year agreement with IRCC.  While the federal government has paused new arrivals in response to the pandemic travel ban, IRCC has said they intend to uphold their commitments, and in fact the 2020 target numbers for RHWR have not changed. We also recognize that the future for all communities has much uncertainty, and our Board is considering a variety of scenarios, including a longer pause on new arrivals. We may, for example, place greater focus on our Employment Programs and social integration efforts, which continue well past the first year.  

The board has developed a Reserve Fund Policy and a reserve fund process that allocates a small percentage of our administrative dollars to that fund. The goal is to develop three months of operational reserves for RHWR. 

As well, over the past year, the KW Multicultural Centre, the YMCA and RHWR have been in conversations about working more closely, sharing facilities and integrating services. We continue to be deeply committed to exploring this as a way of improving services to newcomers and increasing efficiencies and cost savings.

This includes those 70+, at-risk of homelessness, coping with addictions, experiencing domestic violence, struggling with mental health or experiencing a physical disability.  We have witnessed a significant increase in demand for access to food including hot and frozen Meals on Wheels (a 50% increase in frozen entrees) as well as a 100% increase in demand for food hampers and the lunch crunch programs.  Many individuals are also experiencing difficulties in accessing groceries and prescriptions as well as significant social isolation.  Our core programs provide direct access to nutritional food and a source of connection to the community.  Each organization works directly with the most vulnerable residents and is struggling with having adequate capacity to meet the increased demand for services.  In addition to the significant growth rates across the Townships which are surpassing regional and provincial averages and a high number of older adults as compared to other communities in our Region, staff are witnessing increasing demand and increasing complexity and diversity in needs as well as increasing demand by individuals who might not have  traditionally accessed our services.  These needs, especially those associated with availability and access to food and social isolation, are anticipated to continue to climb.  This demand places a strain on the availability of food for individuals in need and on our organizations’ ability to access, store, package and deliver food support as well as to connect with some of our most isolated residents.  Left unaddressed the needs will have a significant impact on our health care system as well as quality of life.","$20,000","Community Care Concepts, in partnership with Wilmot Family Resource Centre and Woolwich Community Services, is seeking funding to enhance existing food support programs to meet current and anticipated demand for access to quality, nutritious food.  Individuals who utilize these programs will include those 70+, at-risk of homelessness, coping with addictions, experiencing domestic violence, struggling with mental health or experiencing a physical disability.  These programs include, but are not limited to, access to hot and frozen Meals on Wheels, food hampers and lunch crunch programs.  Administered out of offices in Elmira and New Hamburg, these services are made available to residents living across the large rural geography of Woolwich, Wellesley and Wilmot Townships.  In addition to increased direct food costs, costs are also associated with increased food storage, packaging, delivery, the need for personal protective equipment while distributing food as well as the potential for fee subsidy for individuals who may require food support but do not have financial resources to contribute program fees, where appropriate.   It is also recognized that in an effort to ensure that vulnerable residents have access to essential supports, our organizations will need to enhance available direct support with grocery shopping and accessing prescriptions.  Our organizations will also need to source out food options beyond our traditional offerings, particularly those associated with individuals experiencing ill health, such as hot soups, applesauce, juice, fruit, etc.  Our organizations will also need to supplement available food with gift cards for grocery stores and pharmacies and identify key distribution methods for these supports to ensure access to food and essential supplies in emergency situations and during evenings and weekends.  

In the delivery of these services, it is also recognized that we will need to implement proactive service delivery models, including the distribution of food to vulnerable residents rather than centralized access, as is the situation with some food support programs.  Taking the service to individuals will maximize physical distancing while responding to the importance to self-isolation.

While the delivery of these food support programs will ensure access to quality, nutritious food sources and other essential supplies, they also serve as an important source of social contact.  Maintaining contact with others is one of the most essential protective factors in maintaining mental and physical health.  A lack of contact, or social isolation, can have detrimental health consequences.  While these programs offer a source of social contact, it is also recognized that there are many other individuals beyond those associated with our services that are socially isolated in our Townships.  With this funding we will implement intentional strategies to identify isolated individuals across our communities and link to appropriate services, supports and organizations.  This will require dedicated resources for promotion as well as technology to support diverse and creative models for maintaining connections with others across our large rural geography.

Combined, these activities enhance capacity and service offerings in our current programs to respond to the changing realities of client demand, need, and service delivery models.  
","The majority of the funds which we are requesting are required for food costs; the storage, packaging, distribution and delivery of food supports; promotional activities to connect with isolated individuals; and, technology associated with revised service delivery models.  We anticipate that 15% of our budget will be allocated to the health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers.  These costs are associated with the provision of personal protective equipment for the distribution of food and in maintaining contact with individuals.  We also anticipate that additional support and training related to ensuring the health, wellness and safety for staff and volunteers who are in roles providing direct service to community members will be required.   As additional health measures are implemented or additional concerns are identified,  ongoing support is required to alleviate concern and anxiety,  ensure health and safety precautions are in place and support revised service delivery models.  ","Community Care Concepts of Woolwich, Wellesley and Wilmot (CCCWWW), Wilmot Family Resource Centre (WFRC) and Woolwich Community Services (WCS) have long histories of serving Woolwich, Wellesley and Wilmot Townships.  While each organization has an expertise in their respective areas of serving seniors and persons with disabilities (CCCWWW) and children, youth, adults and families (WFRC and WCS), and makes their utmost effort to respond based upon the scope and experience  of their services as well as the capacity within each organization,  we have collectively learned that the challenges which each individual or family is facing is often beyond the scope or experience of any one of  our organizations.  Building upon a strong foundation of collaboration and support among the organizations,  the organizations have formed a formalized network to develop and implement intentional strategies to work collaboratively to coordinate services and integrate services and the expertise within each organization to develop multi-agency, coordinated service planning, customized to the unique needs of individuals.  The number and complexity of challenges experienced by our most vulnerable residents requires an intentional, coordinated service delivery approach that stretches beyond what any one organization can provide and leverages the assets of our collective organizations and broader community.  Through adopting this intentional coordinated service delivery strategy, we have demonstrated our ability to support vulnerable residents in our rural Townships of Woolwich, Wellesley and Wilmot. It is our intent to continue to build upon this strategy in the months and years ahead to continue to develop innovative, responsive coordinated strategies to address some of our communities’ most pressing issues.   This will not only sustain us throughout the COVID-19 pandemic but also help us to overcome additional obstacles which our organizations and communities will face in future years.  

As independent organizations we are each financially strong and have ensured access to sufficient reserves to sustain core operations for the next 6 months, or longer.  Within each organization our boards are actively reviewing the financial and service delivery impact of COVID-19 on our organizations and communities.  This includes projecting changes to client or service revenue (as appropriate); revising financial projections;  exploring strategies to reduce costs while maximizing service delivery; exploring required staffing models; accessing wage subsidy programs as appropriate; revising service delivery models to adapt to the changing realities of client demand, need and service restrictions; and, analyzing risks and developing strategies to mitigate risks.  We also remain engaged within our broader communities, working collaboratively with our Municipalities and service delivery partners to understand the broader impact of COVID-19 on our communities and develop collaborative strategies to respond to the challenges. At a broader system planning level, we are also engaged in planning within our respective sectors and at key planning tables to ensure that the needs of rural residents are identified and incorporated into regional planning.

4/9/2020 11:14:34,The Food Bank of Waterloo Region,119233310 RR0001,Wendi Campbell,WendiC@thefoodbank.ca,Caroline Dutka,carolined@thefoodbank.ca,"50 Alpine Court, Kitchener ON, N2E 2M7",https://www.thefoodbank.ca/,"
The Food Bank of Waterloo Region (“The Food Bank”), as the head of the Community Food Assistance Network in Waterloo Region, has recognized several serious challenges that our staff, volunteers and agency partners are facing as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, these challenges refer to the compromised health and safety of staff and volunteers both on-site at The Food Bank and at the customer-facing agencies (locations where individuals in need of food assistance go to pick up their emergency food hampers). 

The Food Bank is an integral part of the Region of Waterloo’s Pandemic and Emergency Plans. The Food Bank has also prepared its own plan in the case of a pandemic, the “Community Food Assistance Network Pandemic Business Continuity Plan,” which was activated on March 23, 2020. But the reality is, preparation can only do so much when the situation has never been experienced before and evolves daily. 

One of the biggest areas of need is for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) – including masks, gloves and sanitizer. The Food Bank will need to invest in a considerable amount of PPE to distribute among Network programs and agencies for the duration of this crisis.

Furthermore, we now recognize that although The Food Bank has health and safety protocols for its staff and volunteers, not all Network programs and agencies have similar processes in place. In response to this procedural gap, The Food Bank will develop a customizable “tool kit” to help programs and agencies launch comprehensive health and safety policies, as well as guidelines for implementing them. This tool kit will not only be essential for times of crisis (such as this current pandemic) but will also help guide ongoing health and safety practices once business-as-usual returns.
","$20,000","All of the activities for which we are requesting funding are to enhance existing service delivery. The Food Bank is not changing or adding to our existing services (to acquire and distribute over 4.5 million pounds of perishable and non-perishable food to local community programs and agency partners annually), we are concerned about making our existing services safer by investing in more Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) to be distributed among the Community Food Assistance Network, and building resources to be shared among the Network’s programs and agency partners to ensure the optimal safety of staff, volunteers and program participants. 

Activity: Purchasing PPE (sanitizer, masks, gloves) for front-line workers (staff and volunteers) at The Food Bank, programs and agencies. 
What is involved: The Food Bank will purchase large quantities of the aforementioned items and distribute to Network programs and agencies along with their regular food deliveries. 

Activity: Develop a health and safety policy “tool kit” to share with Network program and agency partners to help them create and implement health and safety policies.
What is involved: The Food Bank staff (led by the Communications Coordinator for the Community Food Assistance Network) will develop the tool kit; publish and distribute the tool kit; consult with managers, Executive Directors and/or the Board of Directors of the organizations that will be activating the new health and safety policies; implement safety check points or check-ins to ensure ongoing health and safety measures are being maintained.  

Activity: Develop and produce health and safety communications materials (such as posters, pamphlets and other shareable documents) that can be distributed to program and agency partners. 
What is involved: The Food Bank staff will design and print these materials and distribute to program and agency partners to be shared with staff, volunteers and participants (where appropriate). A new staff member, the Communications Coordinator for the Community Food Assistance Network will oversee this process. 

Activity: Hire the Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) to give online training workshops to The Food Bank staff that are responsible for taking calls from the community during this difficult time (call centre). Overwhelming feedback from The Food Bank staff is that they feel inadequately prepared to deal with many of the calls they are receiving from community members expressing mental health problems (anxiety, depression, other). Staff urgently require mental health support training to take these calls.  
What is involved: Hiring staff from the CMHA to give online trainings (via Zoom) to employees of The Food Bank.
","100% of the funding requested is dedicated to supporting the health, wellness and safety of staff and volunteers at The Food Bank, as well as the staff and volunteers of programs and agencies that are members of the Community Food Assistance Network. Activities are all detailed above. ","The Food Bank of Waterloo Region is part of the Region of Waterloo’s Pandemic and Emergency Plans. The Food Bank has also implemented our own “Community Food Assistance Network Pandemic Business Continuity Plan” to ensure the continuation of essential services offered in the community while minimizing health risks during this crisis. As per the Pandemic Business Continuity Plan, the Community Food Assistance Network has reduced the number of programs and agencies in operation (identified as vital programs) to 30. To view the full list of programs, visit: thefoodbank.ca/vitalservice. 

The health and safety of all staff and volunteers throughout the Community Food Assistance Network is of the utmost importance while we balance the needs of the community and our commitment to supporting emergency plans in cooperation with the Region of Waterloo. The Food Bank’s non-essential staff are currently working from home. Essential staff and volunteers working in the warehouse are allowed in the building, but otherwise The Food Bank’s building is not open to the public. All food orders are being delivered to programs and agency partners so that no unnecessary visitors come to The Food Bank warehouse. The Food Bank is abiding by all safety measures recommended by the Region of Waterloo’s Public Health Department and the WHO, including cleaning protocols and physical distancing. 

The Food Bank is being supported financially by the community (individuals, businesses and community organizations). The provincial government is offering support by funding pre-packed food hampers that are being delivered to The Food Bank by Feed Ontario. Funding issued by the federal government will also flow through Feed Ontario via Food Banks Canada. 
 
The Food Bank is preparing for a second wave of COVID-19 (as has been demonstrated in China) and we are going to be ready for when that happens. We are evaluating learnings from the first wave of the pandemic to ensure we are responding to the community’s needs as effectively as possible during times of crisis, while ensuring the health and safety of all staff and volunteers (at The Food Bank and the program and agency partners of the Community Food Assistance Network). Funding received from this request will go directly towards this purpose.

4/9/2020 11:35:45,Canadian National Institute for the Blind ,119219459RR0003,"Robert Gaunt, Executive Director",robert.gaunt@cnib.ca,Katie Haick,katie.haick@cnib.ca,"151 Frederick St #201, Kitchener, ON N2H 2M2",http://cnib.ca/en?region=on_west,"More than 1.5 million Canadians, including 700,000 in Ontario, are blind or partially sighted. These individuals are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to higher rates of mental health issues, multiple disabilities or underlying health conditions, lower incomes, and social isolation. Physical distancing and self-isolation have disrupted routines and supports from family, friends and community, further increasing anxiety and stress amongst this vulnerable population.

Priority concerns:

Getting essential supplies:
Many individuals rely on a sighted person for grocery shopping and are facing ridicule for needing physical support and for the challenge of maintaining a six-foot distance. Delivery services are overwhelmed and cannot take on new customers. Many individuals live on low incomes due to under/unemployment and cannot afford price increases or to stock up on essentials.
Contracting COVID-19 and hospital admittance:
Most individuals who are blind or partially sighted have multiple disabilities or other underlying health issues, and should they contract the virus, are at greater risk of experiencing complications leading to hospitalization. Once admitted, they are afraid they could be denied care based on their disabilities
Being left out of COVID-19 information/communications:
In order to protect themselves and family members, individuals need timely and accurate communications in accessible formats such as large print, braille, e-text from government and public health departments. With information announced daily, it’s a challenge to stay well informed and safe.
Deafblind Canadians:
Canadians who are deafblind face unique challenges – needing interpreters and captioning to obtain information and maintain their health and safety. Tactile communication is no longer possible with physical distancing. It is also very difficult to communicate with doctors who are wearing masks. Voices become muffled and lip reading is not possible. Potentially life-threatening medical misunderstanding could occur.
","20,000","Like all Canadians, CNIB has been monitoring the impact of COVID-19 and actively preparing to meet the demands of this evolving situation. The health and safety of our community remains our top priority. As such, we have made the difficult decision to suspend all drop-in services and in-person programs until further notice.
Combating the negative ramifications of isolation for Canadians with sight loss due to COVID-19 is CNIB Foundation's top priority during this unprecedented time. 
For people who have lost their sight, connecting with others, albeit by phone or virtually, who have experienced the same thing can make a world of difference toward rebuilding confidence, independence and a sense of hope. Research indicates that peer support reduces the incidence of depression and isolation associated with sight loss while helping people gain self-confidence and improve the quality of their lives.
To meet the needs of our community, CNIB has adapted and expanded out program offerings to support our current reality.
Priority Programs include:
Outreach: CNIB Foundation is reaching out to all program participants by telephone to check in with them, provide information on current virtual programs, and to determine if additional support is required. Referrals will be made to appropriate agencies and programs, as needed.
Virtual Vision Mates: During this unprecedented time, one of the easiest things we can do is reach out to each other to engage in conversation and offer support. CNIB Foundation has adapted one of its core program offerings, the Virtual Vision Mate program, to engage volunteers to connect virtually with program participants by phone or online, at least once a week. With physical distancing measures in place, it can be difficult for people with sight loss to pick up their groceries and prescriptions. Virtual Vision Mates can help with these tasks.
Virtual Programming: CNIB Foundation now has hundreds of free virtual program offerings (e.g. career support, tech training, book clubs, youth groups) for Canadians impacted by blindness. Virtual programs can reduce social isolation, provide distraction, education, and recreation, and empower individuals impacted by blindness during these challenging times. A full listing of virtual programs across the country is available at www.cnib.ca/en/event. 
Guide Training: Our Future Guide Dogs are still in the important stages of their training. The health, safety and wellbeing of everyone involved in the CNIB Guide Dogs program, including the dogs themselves, is of the utmost importance to us. Their vital training cannot be interrupted – which is why we’re continuing training in isolation, away from large groups of people and public transit.
Advocacy: With the dynamic circumstances we are currently living in, we are working to advocate for our population to ensure that the rights of those with sight loss and other disabilities are considered and consulted in policies put forth by administration. Also, CNIB continues to monitor the landscape for opportunities to advocate on behalf of the sight loss population (i.e. access to federal support funding to individuals).
","As we have pivoted to virtual programming in order to support the health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers as well as participants, the areas we need help supporting are focused on the delivery of virtual programming, outreach and volunteer management. We have incurred incredible expenses in ensuring that our team can deliver essential services and support to our population, including internet access, suitable technology devices and subscriptions. With the expansion of our Virtual Vision Mate support program, due to increased demand and need from the sight loss population, we are onboarding and training more volunteers and ensuring that they have the strategies and resources needed to ensure the health and safety of themselves and those they connect with.  
Estimated per participant costs:
· Outreach Call - 0.5hr/participant x $30/hr = $15/participant
· Virtual Vision Mate (Volunteer Recruitment, Matching & Support) - $150/participant 
· Virtual Programming (Program Development & Implementation) – $100/participant
","Like most other Foundations, we have had to cancel our major fundraising events, and a number of potential funders have withdrawn funds that we’d applied for in order to redirect them to support COVID-19 efforts. Although we rely on these funds to keep our programs going strong, we're working to stretch every dollar as far as we possibly can so that we meet the needs of each of our clients.
We are working to mitigate financial losses as a result of COVID-19 in a variety of ways including frequent communication with major gift donors, application to COVID-19 relief funds, digital & direct marketing, and advocating on behalf of the non-profit sector to the federal government for emergency response funding.

Under the current state of emergency several NSP sites regionally have closed and virtually all daytime drop-in spaces. The unhoused have few spaces to go to, and we are very concerned about increased HIV and hepatitis C transmission, more individuals sleeping rough, individuals using the streets as toilets, lack of handwashing leading to another hepatitis A outbreak and more community transmission COVID-19 outbreaks happening within our shelter system.
Our ACCKWA NSP sites at 150 Main in Cambridge and St. John’s Kitchen in Kitchener closed March 16th due to the state of emergency.  We received no advance notice to plan alternative distribution sites. We are aware that far fewer individuals are accessing supplies regionally due to this changing availability of supports.
We do not yet have an fully implemented shelter-in-place plan to prevent further community transmission of COVID-19, and it is likely the current state of affairs could seed outbreaks, generating a second wave of infections and burdening our system. A second outbreak in this community could devastate the local response at a point when the health care system is exhausted.
Our local supervised consumption site has asked us for NSP / Naloxone / COVID-19 screening assistance, and we are now providing support at 150 Duke in Kitchener. We are trying to find means to maintain NSP/Naloxone support in Cambridge. We do not have the financial resources to staff outreach in Cambridge and assist the Kitchener CTS appropriately at this time, then transition our peers into the shelter-in-place system as it is implemented. 

","$20,000.00","ACCKWA’s work has leveraged the powerful impact of lived expertise through engaging peers for over a decade. In 2018, this philosophy and practice was formalized and expanded through the development of a dedicated peer program focused on engaging people living with HIV, and individuals in recovery from past substance use as peers in harm reduction and HIV care and support work.  Both our peers and the program have exceeded expectations in both service delivery and overall peer development as we continue to cultivate a climate that focuses on improving overall wellbeing, participation and engagement for isolated service users in Waterloo Region. Within ACCKWA’s Peer Program, the lived expertise of peer volunteers is combined with structured training (motivational interviewing, de-escalation training) and continuous supervision to enable peers to effectively engage in low threshold outreach with harm reduction service users and peer to peer outreach with individuals either newly diagnosed with HIV or challenged in maintaining their well-being. Peer navigators who have successfully managed HIV can share expertise with newly diagnosed PHAs struggling with  HIV management. Navigators use lived experience to educate and empower service users, building capacity so that they can live long, fulfilled, healthy lives with HIV, facilitate self-management of health and help to navigate complex systemic barriers to HIV care and treatment, to achieve well-being. These peers work to support the Peer to Peer Partnership within the Volunteer and Peer Engagement Program.  This program focuses on improving well-being, participation and engagement for isolated service users in Waterloo region. Peers are trained to use their lived experience (HIV, recovery from addictions/substance use and related issues), and other employment related and interpersonal skills to a) assist PHAs who are either new to or struggling with their HIV diagnosis or self-management of their health care, and b) assist the Harm Reduction Coordinator with various program-related tasks, including peer to peer interactions with SafePoint service users. The volunteers will participate in training on HIV and hepatitis C treatment, Naloxone, prevention, positive self-management and modeling self-care, motivational interviewing and decisional balance techniques. Peer volunteer mentors are expected to informally pass on to service users what they learn in their training sessions. The goal is to empower service users to learn and retain information about HIVSTBBIs, develop self-management skills and make informed choices about their lives, harm reduction, wellness and coping strategies, recovery and healthcare.
In August of 2018, Harm Reduction Kit Making became an integrated component of the Peer Program.  In the program, peers and other volunteers work collaboratively.  This group of volunteers has increased our kit making output by 150%, adding on two evening kit making sessions per month. The Peer Program has implemented a new ACCKWA Street Outreach Pilot Project in February 2019. Through this new activity, peers have been able to reach our communities most vulnerable individuals, including those who are street involved, homeless or at risk of being homeless.

","We are seeking funding to assist us in both maintaining our existing peer presence in the  remaining local harm reduction response and expanding that response as peers are needed to assist in new sites in local emergency shelters as they are established. All ACCKWA peers and staff that are part of our harm reduction, food security and PHA (people living with HIV / AIDS) care and support response are essential workers. There work involves linking people to five separate clinical resources for medical care, responding to overdoses, naloxone and harm reduction supplies distribution, and distribution of personal care and food security supplies. One hundred per cent (100%) of the funding requested will go to maintaining the peer response, as turnover is an expected and anticipated facet of peer work. We also unfortunately anticipate peer turnover due to the highly infectious nature of the pandemic.  All staff and peers have been trained in the use of PPE and have access to PPE supplies to facilitate their work. Peer tasks include:
•	Assisting harm reduction service users in the SafePoint program, staffing satellite offices, assisting the Harm Reduction Coordinator with mobile outreach, 
•	Assisting the Coordinator of Support Services with food hamper deliveries,
•	Attend and actively participate in monthly training focused on techniques to enhance client empowerment and self-efficacy, facilitating access to primary health care, HIV specialist, mental health, food security, housing, and income supports
•	Complete a weekly shift (4 hours) with tasks assigned by the Peer Educator
•	Model role competency for peers after being trained on how to use motivational interviewing techniques (OARS) open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, summary reflections
•	Demonstrate appropriate use of self in peer to peer interactions
•	Model appropriate boundaries for peer mentees 
•	Adhere to agency and program policies and procedures
•	Completing required case documentation, database entry 
•	Maintains confidentiality and contributes to various client databases and files 
","ACCKWA has developed a pandemic response plan and is working in partnership with our operational funders, the Ontario Ministry of Health and the Public Health Agency of Canada, as well as clinical partners, the Kitchener Downtown Community Health Centre, and HIV/AIDS Resources and Community Health (ARCH) in Guelph. We are linking service users to health care through virtual care as well as moving all operations that are amenable to online platforms. We continue to seek resources for securing and maintaining harm reduction work, which is vulnerable due to limited operational funding. Board meetings, our AGM and  several outreach programs will continue virtually, and we have adjusted the delivery of our harm reduction program in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe we have demonstrated accountability to our funders, staff, service users and membership through the actions we have taken which prioritize safety for our service users and staff, while allowing for sustainable operations through this period of instability. We appreciate assistance that will help us save lives and reduce illness among the most vulnerable individuals and communities in our Region during this pandemic.",
4/9/2020 11:52:16,Sexual Assault Support Centre of Waterloo Region,132274093RR0001,Sara Casselman,sara@sascwr.org,,sara@sascwr.org,300-151 Frederick St. Kitchener ON N2H 2M2,http://www.sascwr.org ,"The evidence says that an increase in sexual violence, and other forms of gender-based violence, is one of the likely impacts of large-scale crisis, such as natural disasters, wars, and pandemics. Although the measures put in place to prevent of spread of COVID-19 are essential to the health of our community, increased isolation, social distancing, loss of income or employment, and disruptions in daily routines, are all factors that have the potential to create conditions where intimate partner sexual assault, other forms of sexual violence, and child sexual abuse are more common. This means that Sexual Assault Support Centres across the country are likely to see an increase in demand for services both during in the short and long-term aftermath of this crisis. 

Any increase in demand is particularly concerning because we were already facing significant challenges in meeting the demand before this crisis. In the post-#MeToo era, our waiting lists to access free, specialized counselling and advocacy were already at critical levels. Five years ago, 40 survivors on our waiting list was a crisis; over the last couple of years, our waiting list has averaged 140 survivors. Given this reality, before the pandemic, we were already making a critical plea for support. We’d also been growing our fundraising program to help meet the demand.

Now, we’re foreseeing the loss the of well over $100,000 in fundraising revenue, and survivors of sexual violence are in more crisis than ever. Mental health supports during this time are critical. Our team was quick to respond to the pandemic; we’re offering online and phone counselling, online groups and workshops (for the first time in our history), and we’ve doubled our capacity to respond to survivors on our 24-Hour Support Line. 
","$20,000","Money dispersed through the COVID-19 Community Response Fund will help fund our adapted programs and services for survivors of gender-based violence during (and after) the pandemic. We offer support to survivors of sexual assault, sex trafficking, and domestic violence. (More information on our programs can be accessed here: www.sascwr.org.) All our services are free and strictly confidential. 

We’d been counting on $100,000+ fundraising revenue to fund basic salaries across our program areas, although this funding was nowhere near sufficient to deal with backlogs. To be clear, the funding we’re requesting will help us maintain our current staffing levels, not increase them, despite the anticipated increase in the demand for our services. In particular, our priority needs right now are: 

1)	Salaries in our Counsellor/Advocate Program, to ensure online and phone counselling is available to survivors in our community, free of charge. Many survivors struggle with anxiety, depression, isolation, unhealthy coping mechanisms, and overall emotional wellness. During this time, their mental health challenges are significantly magnified. Our Counsellors say that every survivor they speak to has been impacted, and is struggling. For more than thirty years, our motto - a promise to survivors - has always been: You’re not alone. Today, more than ever, we need our community’s support to say this with confidence to survivors. 

2)	Adapting and funding our Online Group & Workshop Program. Before the pandemic, we were offering an average of four weekly in-person workshops and groups for survivors. We’ve moved to an online format, developing curriculum and tools for virtual support as we go. After only a couple of weeks of online offerings, survivors are already reporting that our Online Groups & Workshops have had a significant impact on their well-being and reducing their sense of isolation. You can see our current offerings here: http://www.sascwr.org/online-groups-and-workshops.html We’re committed to adding to this list in the days and weeks ahead.

3)	Ensuring the viability and increased capacity of our 24 Hour Support Line. Bracing for an increase in calls for support, we’ve doubled the capacity of our 24 Hour Support Line to ensure to respond to calls. Our 24 Hour Support Line is now covered with a combination of highly-trained volunteers and members of our staff team. For the first time in our history, this week we began training volunteers online, using the same technology we use for our Groups and Workshops with survivors. 

The only Federal Wage Subsidy we are able to access is the subsidy equal to 10% of the remuneration we pay, up to a maximum of $25,000.
","Our staff are working remotely to ensure we’re doing our part to stop the spread of COVID-19 in our community; we are also doing no-contact, door drop-offs of food, self-care items, and gift cards to some of our clients who are particularly marginalized and in need. 

As a community-based Sexual Assault Support Centre, we have significant experience in supporting our staff and volunteer team as they support people in our community impacted by trauma. We have five key values as an organization, and one of them is this:

*** We promote the self-care and wellness of those working at our Centre; this is a political tool that sustains us in our work. ***

While we haven’t set aside a specific amount of this funding request for the health and wellness of our team, it’s built into our overall budgets and how we operate on a daily basis. The risk of vicarious trauma and burn-out is, and always has been, significant in our field. We are intentional about taking care of our team. 

We have a Vicarious Trauma and Burn-Out Policy and related comprehensive plan for supporting our team to avoid vicarious trauma and burn-out. This includes things like access to external clinical supervision, sick time, personal time, health benefits, ongoing professional development, flexible schedules, nurturing a supportive and caring work culture, etc. 

The people who staff Sexual Assault Support Centres – like those working in health-care, grocery stores, public transit, shelter workers, and food banks – are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis. While our staff are used to working under difficult and precarious working conditions as a result of unstable funding in general, the added pressures presented by COVID-19 and the need to adapt to these conditions in very short timeframes has added worry and stress to our team. This funding is essential for our team so they can carry out their work without the added worry needing to secure resources for our basic work, or the worry that, despite the demand, they could be laid off due to lack of resources. ","Our Board of Directors has supported our management team in setting up remote operations. Our priorities were:

1)	Ensuring all our direct service staff members had all they needed to offer online and phone counselling and support to clients. 

2)	Doubling the capacity of our 24 Hour Support Line to respond to survivors, anticipating an increase in the demand for our services.

3)	Adapting our public education programs to operate in this new reality. Sexual Assault Support Centres have a vital role to play in providing prevention, education, and awareness initiatives about sexual and domestic violence, and all forms of gendered violence, during and after the COVID-19 crisis. For example, it’s particularly important to continue to provide education on consent, sexual assault myths and misconceptions, healthy relationships, and to deliver specialized response training to social workers, educators, police, and other services providers who may be interacting with survivors during this time. Public education programs need to be funded to modify training materials and determine alternative way of delivering training and education that align with current COVID-19 restrictions. 
Our Centre is now set up to the vast majority of our administrative work from home as well. All our meetings are now virtual. We’ve enhanced our communication strategies, to ensure the public knows what services exist to them during this period. Our new website launched this week, which includes a calendar of online groups and workshops for survivors, as well as what online education workshops are open to the public. 

Our team continues to connect with essential community partners through conference calls and virtual meetings to ensure the most vulnerable people we work with have access to the support and basic life necessities needed at this time.

From a leadership perspective, we’re working on seeking out funding to both meet the fundraising short-falls we’re anticipating this year due to COVID-19, and we’re exploring options for additional funding to the meet the anticipated increase in the demand for our services. 

Despite the fact that the majority of our fundraising plans for this year have been, or likely will be, cancelled, we’re working on adapting our plans to promote virtual fundraising. We are well-aware that this strategy won’t bring in the amount of revenue we’d planned, but we need to bring in what we can, to ensure our vital services are available to survivors throughout and after this crisis. 

We are, however, bracing ourselves for a very challenging year.

4/9/2020 12:16:21,Interfaith  Counselling Centre,119055234,Lisa Akey,lakey@interfaithcounselling.ca,Matthew Isert Bender,misertbender@interfaithcounselling.ca,"23 B Church Street, New Hamburg, N3A 1J1",https://www.interfaithcounselling.ca/index.php,"The emotional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are far-reaching and we have yet to see their full ramifications.  Everyone is experiencing added stressors to their lives; some people are working the front lines, others have been laid off, some have lost someone to this pandemic, others worry about their own health or that of loved ones, and many more are experiencing a sense of heightened anxiety. 
Those currently struggling with mental health challenges are particularly vulnerable and it is increasingly important to ensure that everyone gets the mental health support they need to avoid increased demands for intensive treatment and further strain on police and hospital services. 

At a time of great uncertainty and anxiety, we are working together with the self-organized network called the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region (Carizon Family and Community Services, Family Counselling Centre of Cambridge and North Dumfries, KW Counselling Services, Shalom Counselling Services, Woolwich Counselling Centre and Interfaith Counselling Centre) to lessen the financial stress of accessing services.  We believe that cost should never be a barrier to getting help. With the support of the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), the CCWR has been able to provide counselling sessions free of charge via telephone or video chat for the three weeks, up to April 5th, 2020 for those who otherwise would not have been able to receive counselling.  

As the need continues to increase, we at ICC are reaching out for broader community support to be able to continue providing funded counselling sessions for those who need it most within the rural community of Wilmot.
","20,000","At ICC our mission is to strengthen the fabric of our community by empowering individuals, couples, and families to realize their emotional wellness and triumph over life’s challenges.  As an agency within the CCWR our particular focus is to serve the rural community.  We serve the townships of Wilmot, Wellesley, Perth East, Blandford-Blenheim & East Zorra, with 80% of the clients we serve being Waterloo Regions residents and who are predominately from Wilmot township. 

We at ICC are committed to continue to provide mental health services to those especially in the rural community, who need it now more than ever during this challenging and uncertain time. Counselling is a key component of the continuum of mental health supports and we are seeking funding to continue providing funded counselling sessions to address these demands and stressors and provide a sense of stability for those impacted by mental health challenges during this time social isolation and increased financial struggle limiting many individuals ability to seek mental health support. 

ICC in the past few weeks has gone through a complete service transformation to keep staff and individuals safe and healthy. Counselling is happening from home offices as we are supporting people in new ways through, digital resources, and phone or video sessions. Counselling appointments are being offered at flexible times five days a week and every other Saturday to connect individuals with support. 

ICC primarily is looking for support with funding to ensure if not enhance our ability to subsidize or fully fund the cost of counselling historically around 85% of our counselling is subsidized with 10% of this being fully subsidized.  We are concerned with our ability to do this moving forward as our annual silent auction the last Saturday in April, which typically raises $20000 has been cancelled.  The anticipated loss of fundraising dollars in conjunction with an anticipated increasing need for subsidized counselling deeply concerns us.   We recognize the importance of supporting individuals during this time as it will help prevent emergency services and the mental health system from additional stress and pressure. By working with our clients, we are not just putting a Band-Aid on an identified need; instead, we help change their perspectives and guide them as they take concrete steps to move forward.  There is a clear body of literature that demonstrates the clinical and cost effectiveness of early intervention counselling for low and moderate mental health issues.
","As mentioned before, as a member of CCWR we have been able to provide funded counselling sessions up to and including April 5th, 2020. As the situation with COVID-19 continues to evolve, we recognize that the mental health supports in our communities are needed more than ever, as more individuals and families struggle with their finances among the other stressors added by this pandemic and its uncertainty. Access to mental health services for all individuals remains our core mission, are continued ability to offer funded counselling services means clients do not have to wait or be concerned about the financial barriers and will be able to address their concerns before they turn into a full-blown crisis. 

Additionally, trauma stewardship is a strategic focus for us at ICC as we realize it is essential to support the mental health of our counselling staff.  Supporting clients during their mental health struggles is a drain on the well-being of our counsellors especially during this time of pandemic when counsellors are dealing with the same trauma and grief as the clients they are supporting.  We have increased our supervision meeting weekly for a digital check-in and regularly sending staff updates to all our counsellors.  20% of the funds would be geared to additional supervision and training to support our counsellors in their work from home.  For example, our play therapist just completed a training on providing play therapy through video counselling.

The $20,000.00 we are requesting will greatly help to ensure that not only can we offer the mental health services that are greatly needed in our community, but it will also allow us to continue to support the wellness of our staff during this time and with some funding in place provide us time to develop alternative fundraising initiatives while maintaining our ability to subsidize counselling.  
","Currently, we are working together with the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region guided by a joint strategic planning initiative in 2018 and by our strategic plan at ICC.  CCWR senior leaders have been in weekly conversations together continuing to seek ways to share resources, reducing costs and maximizing service to our clients.

At ICC, the board’s executive is receiving weekly updates on our counselling numbers to access what is happening in regards to income and expenses and any changes in course which might be required to ensure sustainability.  The initial focus was to transform our existing services to remote delivery so that we can respond to the mental health impacts of isolation and social and physical distancing due to COVID-19 on existing and new clients.   

Now that remote counselling is established sustainability of the agency and the well-being of our staff is our focus.  In the short term, with all counselling happening remotely we have laid off one part-time staff who provided office support during evening and weekend counselling hours.  In addition, we are exploring all options to access government-related subsidies.  With all these changes happening so quickly, no further plans are in place at this point.

4/9/2020 12:18:45,Mennonite Central Committee Ontario (MCC),11903 8263 RR0001,John Head,john.head@mcco.ca,Wendy Adema,wendy.adema@gmail.com,"50 Kent Avenue, Kitchener",https://mcccanada.ca/stories/what-we-do-ontario,"“Connectivity in the time of Covid-19"" is our three month project to intentionally reach out to the most vulnerable and marginalised of our regular program participants in the KW area. Through MCC Ontario’s Restorative Justice and Walking with People in Poverty programs we support individuals who have been homeless and/or involved in the criminal justice system as they strive to integrate into community. Given face-to-face meeting restrictions along with no access to phones or computers with internet, this population is extremely isolated. These individuals are living in half-way houses, supportive housing, shelters, rooming houses or apartments with limited access to technology and internet connectivity. For some members in shelters or rooming houses, access to shared phones and computers are only available in community rooms that are currently under lock-down given Covid-19 restrictions. For individuals who have a history with the criminal justice system, we know that isolation is a risk factor for further offences. Due to Covid-19, there will be a greater number of community releases by Correctional Services Canada. Some of these released individuals will require increased community supports as they would be released with limited parole support. Most of the individuals we are trying to reach would be over the age 50 and many have other health and mental health challenges. Some would be struggling with various addictions. Access to affordable food and healthy entertainment options are very limited. Many of these individuals suffer from feelings of abandonment and lack of self-esteem. Further isolation at this time will only exacerbate these negative feelings. ","$20,000","Through this three month project, we will be purchasing phones or devices with connectivity to the internet as well as other activity supports to get to some of these most isolated program participants. Staff working remotely will source appropriate supplies, get them to various locations and figure out ways to provide the necessary training to individuals who may be learning new technologies. In some cases, temporary internet and/or phone connectivity suppliers will be sourced. Resources will be tailored to each unique individual program participant’s needs, interests and situation. 
We will explore ways to engage online and over the telephone in manners that promote community and social inclusion as well as mental and physical health. Our staff and volunteers will join program participants remotely in these activities (games, cooking, book clubs, etc.) online or via teleconference, so they feel ongoing sense of connectivity with staff and volunteers with whom they have established relationships. For example, there might be one circle of support that will meet on a particular afternoon via teleconference (because internet not available) to bake bread (supplies and recipe provided in advance).
There is a growing recognition that this time of Covid-19 is stressful and anxiety producing. There are many online resources to encourage wellness, shore up resilience, self-esteem and mental health. However, the population we are targeting are ‘at risk’ but not able to access these resources. Through this project, we want to share mental health resources along with activities for individuals in remote settings that contribute to their skill building, social inclusion and well-being. Cooking resources will be made available to help ensure access to healthy food and create avenues for connections. For example, we will explore whether participants could possibly sew comforters and relief kit bags to become part of MCC’s relief supplies. Another example would be meeting via phone or online for an exercise session. Activity kits (puzzles etc), mental health care kits as well as at home physical activity kits would be assembled and delivered to participants homes.
We will plan for the careful consideration and management of equitable distribution of resources. In order to ensure equity, we plan to further partner and coordinate with existing services who engage in community connectivity such as Lutherwood, Correctional Services Canada, and Salvation Army. In addition, we want to maintain the resources and integrity of the program while managing potential loss, damage, security concerns, etc. One goal is to include participants in the development of this program to ensure the buy-in from them directly and a sense of personal and community ownership over the resources provided.
It is paramount that we learn what works effectively given our current realities for participants. We also want to take from this time of learning the ability to carry the creativity forward in a way that will continue to allow us to connect to people that are marginalised.
","Given the pandemic situation, we will have to work at ways to implement this project in a safe manner that follows all current public health requirements. Staff and volunteers will be supported and trained as they take on new modes of working to reach out to isolated individuals during this trying time of social distancing. Regular phone and zoom check-ins will be established to ensure that staff and volunteers are trained and supported. The project supervisor and IT staff training and support portions of our budget will facilitate this training and support. MCC is well-positioned to do this through using videoconferencing technology and an online training platform. However, other creative means of connectivity will be explored.
As well, with this project we will find ways to recruit and onboard volunteers remotely and then determine steps to connect them with isolated individuals to help foster community and connections. Building volunteer capacity to support connectivity will be important. This will involve online virtual methods to support recruitment, selection, and training. MCC would have to increase our FTE capacity to advertise, onboard, and orient new volunteers to support community members and those on parole with specific training geared to each population served.
We will continue to partner with local agencies to shore up a community of staff and volunteer supports working with marginalised and isolated individuals in the KW area.
We are continuing to monitor funds that may become available from the federal government for wage subsidies. We believe that we qualify and will be processing our application. To sustainably manage within current financial resources, we have had to lay-off some program staff and reduced the FTE for others. Currently our plan is to bring some staff back from unemployment. 
","At this point, we are looking at all options to ensure the ongoing viability of our organization. In 2020, MCC is celebrating its centennial year so we have many years of history and experience from which to draw on in times of crisis. We have already been reaching out to donors for support at this time as we are concerned that donations will drop off given economic uncertainty. Unfortunately, we have had to close our Thrift Shops across the province which are a significant source of social enterprise revenue for our organization. At this point, revenue from other grant sources (Region of Waterloo, some private foundations and the federal government) look like they will remain secure for the coming year. For service continuity we continue to partner with many local agencies and reach out to our many committed donors and supporters.",Please be in touch if additional information would be helpful for your review of our application.

Prior to COVID-19 we had been engaged in a project with women seniors in Northern ON addressing issues of social insolation and to promote well-being and mental health. The main obstacle for these women was distance to community centres, particularly in winter. This was done through the creation of digital communities centred around archiving social histories, storytelling and creation of digital plays that were co-created with and then read to the group over a series of several sessions.  The project was co-facilitated by a healthcare professional (Chiropractor) who is also an award-winning playwright, Kristin Shepherd and director Lisa O'Connell. We believe this project could assist with isolation of seniors in Waterloo Region during the current crisis. Shepherd is currently Pat the Dogs' Ontario Arts Council Playwright in Residence and winner of the national Samuel French Playwriting Award. 

Working with partners at local community centres and long-care centres we would create no less than 1and more than 3 digital communities of 15 seniors each, alongside 2 facilitators (Shepherd and O'Connell) and 1 tech support for each session.  Sessions would run 2 times per week for a 6 week period. Each session to be 60 minutes long. Timelines could be adjusted as need and dictated by the current crisis. We are also able to train and mentor other centres or groups how to do this project as well during hands-on mentoring if there is interest. Volunteers will be required for this action.

 We require assistance for enhanced IT, volunteer management for mentees, and staffing.We are making application to the federal wage subsidy program for our FT staff (O'Connell).","Funding for this initiative would be paid to the cultural contract workers (Shepherd, arts-worker tech support) which would amount for 75% of the funding.  The rest of the funding would be used to pay for the platform.  Cultural/contract/gig workers have been one of the groups most impacted by COVID-19. ","We are a sustainable federally incorporated cultural organization with core funding from all three tiers of government:  Municipal, Provincial, Federal.  We also have received project funding and awards Internationally. (British Council for New Conversations). We have always worked in partnership with arts and cultural groups locally, provincially and federally and will continue to do so.  We currently hold a Sector Innovation and Development award from Canada Council, now in Year 2, for Regional Women Lead which address gender-parity for women cultural workers across Canada. In this project alone we are partnering with more than 125 women-lead groups and business across the country. Locally with have worked with all arts/cultural and social innovation orgs, including KWAG, MT Space, Neruda, KPL, CITS, Waterloo Global Science Initiative/Power Shift, Coalition Muslim Women, Geek Girls Waterloo Region, to name just a few. 

We have emergency laid-off 2 FT staff and have closed our micro-performance space Edna's till 2021. We are making application for the federal subsidy program for the remaining staff. We are in discussions presently with two local non-profits about using shared office space. We are hunkered down and positioned well to survive this crisis.  We seek to see how best we can serve our community at this time and during this crisis. We want to help.",

Langs is co-leading a Cambridge COVID-19 Planning Committee to address the needs of this population that includes the Cambridge Shelter Corporation, Argus, Women’s Crisis Service, the Cambridge Self Help Food Bank, Canadian Mental Health Association, the Region, the City and Waterloo Region Police Services. Our concentration to date has been on establishing an isolation site for anyone who has symptoms and that is homeless including those individuals who do not use shelter services (e.g. tent city population). One of our physicians who has the most experience with this population has taken on the role as Clinical Lead. In addition we are offering virtual visits, home visits and some appointments for those who urgently need to be seen. We are reaching out to seniors in isolation, youth in need and anyone with mental health and addictions challenges. We check in daily with students that were attending our alternative education program. Our facility is open for those who need a shower. For our families we are providing information about a variety of online resources while kids are self-isolating at home. We are seeing increased anxiety and stress about seniors, individuals with chronic conditions and families ability to meet their basic needs including food, clothing, rent and income overall. We are quite concerned about seniors and  working poor families we serve who only have a phone and relied on free Wi-Fi because they could not afford monthly internet fees. We are developing new strategies to serve seniors to help meet their basic needs while at home and youth to help them maintain physical distancing. This is the key issue and population we will address with this application.","20,000","The core activities we are requesting funding for include i) creating toolkits for seniors that include some basic need supplies and activities as well as for children and youth of all ages during this pandemic. ii) creating virtual camps and activities for youth led by our community services staff and our social work team. 

The survival/toolkits would consist of activities to do at home for seniors and families who have limited resources and will be further disadvantaged by a loss of the limited income they may have received. We would expect to prepare and distribute a minimum of 200 toolkits that would be delivered by our staff using the correct PPE. The kits could accompany food from the Cambridge Self Help Food Bank. For seniors, the kits would consist of item such as some personal hygiene products, exercise bands, reading and puzzle books. For families and kids, the kit will vary by age groups and will include games, crafts and some snacks that wouldn’t be available in a food hamper.  Many of the seniors and parents we serve have chronic conditions and need to stay at home. The criteria to receive a toolkit would include:  i) seniors and parents of children that have chronic conditions who are at greater risk if they don’t stay home ii) individuals and families are a limited or fixed income iii) seniors and families that live in congregate environments such as Waterloo Region Housing and apartment complexes.  

Langs staff are currently participating in online professional development training to learn how to prepare and offer virtual camps and activities for children and youth that focus on fun, wellness and social support. We believe that the local schools boards will be addressing the challenges regarding computer and internet access in order to facilitate online learning. There will be increased costs to implement this plan to obtain the appropriate platforms to ensure security for our youth accessing these services, particularly access to mental health support and counselling. 
","As a provider of health care services, Langs has put the appropriate measures in place to ensure the health and well-being of staff and volunteers. Our team has prepared and implemented a variety of wellness strategies to support staff. We have a wellness activity onsite/online a few times a week for staff using physical distancing and limiting it to 5 people at a time (e.g. meditation workshops). We have purchased and distributed resources for staff to work at home (e.g. ergonomic back supports). The Langs Board had its first virtual board meeting in March. We have developed three e-newsletters focused on topics such as wellness, nutrition and financial health during this pandemic. This newsletter is for volunteers, friends of Langs, community partners and our participants. We will be producing additional newsletters with related topics over the coming weeks. We distributing Tim Horton gift cards to all volunteers for volunteer appreciation week in lieu of our annual celebration. We are using our existing resources to address these needs above and have not request a percentage of funds in this grant as a result. ","Langs will continue to provide essential services throughout this pandemic and will continue to develop innovative ways to meet community needs. We have no concerns about the viability of our organization over the next six months. There will be some impacts on loss of revenue from fundraising and room rentals that we believe will be offset by decreased expenditures in other areas because we are not fully operational. Now that we are in week 4 of this reality we believe we have adapted well to working at home and supporting our patients and participants virtually.  Our team has identified significant concerns about the health and well-being of our community post COVID. We expect to see increases in addictions, increased trauma associated with domestic violence. We believe the health and social services community should be planning now for the increased demand.  These are issues we will bring forward to the Cambridge COVID-19 Planning Committee to address.

4/9/2020 12:55:24,Woolwich Counselling Centre,11930 2099 RR 0001,Amanda Wood-Atkinson,amanda.woodatkinson@woolwichcounselling.org,,,"65 Memorial Ave, Elmira ON, N3B 2R9",http://www.woolwichcounselling.org,"Woolwich Counselling Centre (WCC) is a community based counselling centre serving the residents of the Townships of Woolwich and Wellesley.  Along with all others in the world, our local communities, families and individuals are struggling to adapt and cope with our new reality. WCC supports this community with a variety of mental health needs, including stress management, anxiety, depression, grief and loss, self-esteem, anger management, self-harm, parenting, trauma – among other issues.  This work is accomplished through individual, couple, family and group counselling, as well as workshops, education sessions and school programs. WCC also has a reputable child and youth therapy program including many group sessions, workshops, individual play therapy and school programs designed specifically for the needs of children and youth.  Serving a rural population and meeting its unique needs is also a strength of this small agency.  We have developed strong relationships with the rural Mennonite population and are active in providing supports as needed.  

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are anticipating the mental health needs of our community to increase.  Mental health in general is of great concern as the challenging circumstances continue to unfold.  We are the experts in our community in regard to managing anxiety and depression and we will continue to offer our services throughout this time.  We also recognize that financial stresses may further exacerbate mental health.  It is our belief that cost should not be a barrier to accessing help that is needed and we are committed to providing funded services where ever possible.  
","$20, 000","We have encountered an environment that was completely unanticipated!  However, as a testament to the strength, resilience and creativity of this agency, the Centre has maintained our operations while trying to limit the negative impact to clients.  In concert with many other service providers in the Region and in the province, over the course of this short time period, we have entirely changed our service delivery model.  Staff are now working remotely, out of their homes, providing telephone and/or video counselling to clients.  
The uptake from clients has been strong – most counsellors have continued to maintain their caseloads and we are continuing to accept new referrals.  We have moved quickly to access and provide training to our staff about the use of virtual tools for counselling.  Woolwich Counselling Centre is very well known for our strong children’s mental health support through groups and individual child therapy and we are working with clients to find supportive solutions for children and youth.  We are pleased to say that we have launched our first online anxiety group for teens and are exploring further possibilities for other children and youth.  

We plan to continue to offer individual and couple counselling through telephone and video sessions.  We have begun to offer child therapy sessions via video counselling and see this as an essential tool to continue to support children and youth.  Furthermore, we are planning to offer some online workshops and groups to children and parents.  It is a priority in our agency to reach vulnerable children and families, as well as those impacted by abuse or stressed home environments, and we believe that telephone and video counselling will help us to do this.  

In order for our agency to continue to offer these valuable services, we will need to make additional purchases in terms of technological supports.  There are unanticipated costs associated with this change in direction, including software purchases and updates, as well as equipment purchases.  To offer beneficial child sessions, we have explored training and research to be able to provide effective treatment to children and youth.  We have also needed to upgrade systems to meet privacy legislation regarding the collection and use of personal health information via technological means, as well as ensure confidentiality for our clients.  

In terms of staffing, we are working with all current staff to meet the demands of service.  We remain a committed partner with the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region and in conjunction with this group, were able to secure some funding through the Local Health Integration Network (LHIN) to provide free counselling services for a two week period until April 5, 2020.   Following that brief period of funding, we are anticipating further increases in demand over time. We will continue to work in partnership with the Collaborative to secure funding in order to remove financial barriers to clients.  We will need to look at staffing requirements to meet the demands for services as they develop.  
","As described above, WCC has made some initial purchases in order to move to a remote environment, but there are further supports required.  All of our staff are now working from home.  In order to provide safe and secure environments for them to continue to work, we would like to purchase several more laptops, headsets and upgraded software.  This will allow us to meet legislated requirements for privacy of personal health information.  Additionally, this will allow us to provide for the security of our data and systems.  Furthermore, working from home is a new environment for most of our staff, so we are requesting funding to purchase devices to support this work, as well as provide for the health and safety needs of our staff.  Approximately 30% of the requested funding will go toward the needs of our staff.  However, this same equipment will also be used to the benefit of clients as video sessions would not be possible without this funding.  We believe that video counselling is the best way to meet the needs of children and youth in particular.  ","We anticipate the need for mental health supports will rapidly grow as this unprecedented situation continues to unfold.  WCC is working hard to maintain connections with community partners and work together where we can.  

WCC remains a committed partner of the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region.  The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region consists of the following counselling agencies: Carizon Family and Community Services, Family Counselling Centre of Cambridge and North Dumfries, KW Counselling Services, Interfaith Community Counselling Centre, Shalom Counselling Services and Woolwich Counselling Centre. 

The Collaborative has shared a long-standing partnership, capitalizing on strong collaboration, unique strengths and the mutual vision of a system where referrals to counselling are smooth, seamless and straightforward. The services provided are available to everyone and the infrastructure required to support the system is both efficient and robust. Working together, the Collaborative has been able to develop the framework for centralized access to counselling services to ensure a single point of contact, integrate services, and provide person-centred and effective support to those in our community. 
The Collaborative is committed to continue providing mental health services to those who need it now more than ever during this challenging and uncertain time. Counselling is a key component of the continuum of mental health supports and we are seeking funding to continue providing funded counselling sessions to address these demands and stressors and provide a sense of stability for those impacted by mental health challenges that are increasing during the social isolation period.

The Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region completed a joint strategic planning initiative in 2018, which guides our work together. This work is also supported by the strategic planning of Woolwich Counselling Centre individually. 
Transforming the existing services to respond to isolation and social and physical distancing due to COVID-19 is an extension of the Collaborative services. The current infrastructure of the CCWR will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of offering counselling session through telephone and/or video conferencing as a new way to deliver services in the future in order to better respond to the needs of the community. 

Woolwich Counselling Centre is also working in partnership locally with other services in Woolwich and Wellesley to ensure the needs of our immediate community can be met. We work closely with Woolwich Community Services and Woolwich Community Health Centre on a number of programs and will continue to do so in order to ensure that the residents of our communities can access the services they need.  We are supporters of the Woolwich Residents Relief Fund and will continue to share resources as possible throughout the community.  WCC also works with the Elmira and District Ministerial Association to provide services to members of the community.  

If needed in the future, we will also look to the Federal Wage Subsidy program to support our services.

4/9/2020 13:08:44,Community Justice Initiatives of Waterloo Region,106962707 RR0001,Chris Cowie,chrisc@cjiwr.com,Stacey Colliver,staceyc@cjiwr.com,49 Queen St. N. 3rd Floor,http://www.cjiwr.com,"CJI’s Stride program is facing a crisis. Before they set foot in prison, Canada’s female inmates are among the most vulnerable people in the country. Their prison experience is also marked by violence as women are subjected to the impact of isolation, exclusion, and disconnection in addition to the physical, emotional, and sexual violence that women experience in prison. Upon release, women face significant barriers to reintegration. In addition to finding housing and work, women also deal with stigma, re-establishing their role as parents, establishing positive relationships and finding their place in the community. For over 20 years, CJI’s Stride program has been helping women in prison navigate these barriers.  

COVID-19 has reached Grand Valley Institution and as a result, women are living in lockdown, unable to access phones and in such close living quarters, both staff and women are in great risk of contagion. As a result of this lockdown, CJI’s Stride program is no longer able to access the prison. The women who are incarcerated there are now, more than ever, completely isolated from positive community connections and support, placing a great strain on their mental health.  

CJI hosts two annual fundraisers in support of Stride in the spring: a garage sale and the Super Sweet Stride Retreat, both of which are now indefinitely postponed and will result in a loss of approximately $10,000 in revenue. In addition, CJI has been advised by Correctional Services Canada (CSC), who provides funding for one of our Stride staff positions, that our annual contract will be reduced as a result of our inability to access the prison. This places staff positions at CJI in jeopardy and will impact our ability to provide services to the women on an on-going basis this fiscal year.  ","10,400","CJI’s Stride program is seeking funding to augment the services we provide supporting women in prison. In order to continue to provide any kind of support, we need to be able to retain our current staffing compliment. Given the loss of funding from CSC as well as our fundraisers, CJI is seeking $10,400 to provide the following services:  

In order to continue to support women currently incarcerated at GVI, we plan to create weekly activity packages for women to complete inside the prison. These packages would consist of activity sheets, craft materials and instructions.  We estimate the cost of the activity kits at $2400 ($200/box, per week for 12 weeks). This would impact approximately 150 women inside GVI.  

In addition, Stride supports women living in halfway houses who are transitioning from the prison to the community during the last portion of their sentence. Many of these women in halfway houses do not have access to technology and as a result are unable to maintain social connections with family, friends and their Stride volunteers. $1500 (8 weeks of 0.25 FTE) in funding would be used to run a “tech drive”. Donations collected would be distributed to women living in halfway houses so that they can maintain positive social connections in the community. 

Lastly, the community support provided by Stride to women leaving prison receives no dedicated government funding and is greatly impacted by the loss of our fundraising dollars. Stride staff and volunteers are currently supporting women in the community virtually and by telephone. It is imperative that this work continues so that these women do not face additional social isolation during this time. This work equates to approximately $6500 (12 weeks of 0.5 FTE).  

In addition to the women we are currently supporting, Stride may receive an imminent influx of low-risk women, particularly those who are housed in the minimum-security compound, as they are released early into the community as a result of COVID19. If this occurs, Stride staff will provide each newly released woman with a release package of hygiene and safety necessities, provide referrals and guidance to access local referral sources and provide emotional support via phone and digital platforms. The tech drive could also be used to support these newly reintegrating women.  

Please note that CJI does not currently qualify for the federal wage subsidy program as our agency has not sustained a loss of 30% of our income. ","All of the funds requested are to assist our program participants through the impact of the isolation during this pandemic.   

CJI has worked to ensure that the health, wellness and safety of our staff and volunteers are paramount during this time. We are virtually connecting regularly, and working to ensure that staff positions are secure during this time of uncertainty. Volunteers are provided with regular updates from our volunteer coordinator, as well as their individual program staff. ","At this point, CJI has not needed to make plans for additional partnerships, outside those that already exist at our agency, for service continuity. The majority of our core funding is not at risk; Stride is the only program that has a funding loss at this point. If core programs’ funding were to become at risk, the board would be asked to make decisions regarding our reserve fund.  

CJI has a reserve fund that can be accessed in times of crisis to ensure ongoing operations. When CJI experiences a year-end surplus, the surplus funding is placed in the reserve fund. The purpose of the reserve fund is to enable the agency to sustain operations through delays in payments of committed funds, to accept reimbursable contracts and grants without jeopardizing ongoing operations, and to promote public and funder confidence for our long-term sustainability. If the viability of our agency were at risk, the reserve fund could be accessed to sustain operations. ",I will email documents to the email address provided.
4/9/2020 13:12:50,Family & Children’s Services of the Waterloo Region Foundation,88534-6817-RR0001,Karen Spencer,karen.spencer@facswaterloo.org,Jill Stoddart,Jill.stoddart@facswaterloo.org,"65 Hanson Avenue, Kitchener, ON N1C 4DR",https://www.facswaterloo.org/foundation,"The Foundation is committed to preventing child abuse and neglect, working alongside Family & Children’s Services of the Waterloo Region (FACSWR). We do this by funding needed programs and services not covered by government funding. The current pandemic is creating a myriad of consequences that extend beyond the spread of disease (e.g., pushing systems and structures beyond normal capacity). We need to support FACSWR staff and the people they support to ensure continuity of care (O’Brien, Webster and Herrick, 2007) as everyone adapts to the new situation.
FACSWR serves some of the highest needs, most vulnerable people in our community, and for them, the consequences of COVID-19 are far reaching and dire. A significant proportion of these families already struggle to meet basic day-to-day necessities(Lefebvre et al., 2017). More families will need help – historically, economic downturns result in an increase in cases of child abuse and maltreatment (Seddighi, Salmani, Javadi, & Seddighi, 2019).
Due to physical distancing, in person child welfare visits in Ontario are being limited to only the most urgent situations (OACAS, 2020). This will leave countless children, youth, and families without support. To meet their needs, sector experts have recommended home visits with children, youth, and families be managed virtually).
As FACSWR shifts from in-person support, access to appropriate technology is an unmet need for many of the youth and families served. Without access to phones, data or internet, they cannot participate in these virtual home visits. Frontline staff are also concerned about the ability of families to reach emergency services and stay in touch with loved ones and support networks. This is key to their wellbeing, especially now. Therefore, technology is an urgent need for the children, youth, and families we serve.
",20000,"As stated above, the Foundation supports the needs of some of the most vulnerable children and families in our community, served by FACSWR. 
From March 23-27, 2020 FACSWR conducted a preliminary needs assessment with child protection workers asking how many youth or families on their caseload needed a cellphone, phone plan, or additions to a preexisting plan. The assessment highlighted a gap in access to technology and determined that approximately 300 youth or families currently needed both a cellphone and a plan. Another 200 youth or families require additional time or data added to a preexisting plan. 
Although lack of access to technology existed prior to the pandemic, it was not previously a barrier to mandated service delivery. Physical distancing and increased social isolation has highlighted the importance of technology in maintaining personal wellbeing. We believe that the pandemic has brought to light a hidden barrier and it is urgent that we address this technological gap, which we anticipate to be a growing and ongoing area of need.  
With this knowledge, the Foundation would like to focus on capacity building, as FACSWR staff and the families we serve pivot to a completely different model of service delivery.  
Technology Needs Assessment - In partnership with the Foundation, the FACSWR Research and Innovation Department will conduct a comprehensive technology needs assessment with child protection staff to better understand which devices (cellphones, laptops etc.) and/or services (wireless time and data plans, internet access etc.) are required. This will be accomplished through online surveys and other virtual means. The Foundation has a longstanding relationship with the Research and Innovation Department, which regularly provides data and research related to grants. 
Technology Partnership - Drawing on community contacts, the Foundation will seek a partner who can meet the broad range of technological needs identified in the assessment. This includes, but is not limited to, cellphones, plans, data, computers, and internet access at a group/discounted price. While we regularly engage in partnerships, this area of need is new to the Foundation as a funding priority. 

Distribution of Technology - Working with our technology partner, the Foundation will ensure rapid distribution of necessary technology to youth and families while respecting physical distancing requirements. This is a new logistical consideration for the Foundation, which normally relies on Child Protection staff to distribute required items. COVID-19 safety practices dictate that this may not be possible, and we will need to utilize a third party delivery service. 
While disaster is changing the way FACSWR serves families’ needs at the moment, this ‘forced’ pivot will allow FACSWR to better meet the needs of the families we serve in non-traditional and non-typical ways. This is a watershed moment for how we deliver service both now and in the future. While we have addressed mostly concerns around protection, access, and connection, these technologies will also enable children to stay connected to their classrooms and their learning while schools are closed. 
","Facilitating on-going connection with families, family members and other support networks is vital to preventing child abuse and neglect at this time (Kelly & Hansel, 2002).  

Child protection staff are essential workers every day but especially now. 100% of the requested funding will support staff and volunteer safety. If FACSWR were to only respond to urgent situations requiring face-to-face contact, countless children/youth and families would be left without critical support. While there are challenges, COVID-19 presents an opportunity to be creative and flexible with how we interact with families. However it is of paramount concern to ensure that child protection staff stay healthy and safe during this period. This is critical for the sustainability of child welfare, as shortages in child protection workers due to illness would place our most vulnerable families at immense risk. 

Aforementioned, the current situation is having a significant impact on operations, which includes shifting staff to remote work and physical distancing requirements. As part of the Child Welfare Service Contingency Plan for COVID-19 Pandemic (OACAS, 2020), FACSWR is using a vulnerability scale to determine when face-to-face contact is necessary. This moves the vast majority of home visits with families to virtual platforms (e.g., skype; facetime; zoom). To ensure the continuity of care during the pandemic, we must address the technological barriers these youth and families face.

Ensuring that families and youth have the resources they need to operate virtually will decrease the transmission of COVID-19 in the Waterloo Region. Naturally, the move to minimize face-to-face contact, unless needed according to the vulnerability scale, will support the health, wellness, and safety of staff.

FCSWR's directive to protect staff:

Key Principles:
- The health and safety of our staff and the families we serve is our top priority and we want to minimize in person contact. 
- We are an essential service and must continue to provide high quality protection services to children and their families.
- Follow the direction of public health officials.
- Flexibility in our approach to address challenges and opportunities as they emerge

Criteria to consider for Face-to-Face Contact (in combination with Vulnerability Scale)
- Where information indicates that a child or youth may have been seriously harmed or may be at serious risk of harm (physical, sexual, emotional, neglect)
- Where other safety planning measures or virtual contact methods are insufficient to mitigate serious risk or serious harm.  
- Removal and placement or replacement.
- Older youth in crisis within nonexistent supports.

Face-to-face Team:
- There will be two teams of 10 people (plus substitute team).
- The two teams will manage all face-to-face contact for the agency’s various departments. 
- When a Supervisor determines that a face-to-face visit is required, a consultation will occur between the Worker, Supervisor, and Service Director for approval. Subsequently, a safety plan including proposed use of PPE will be developed and documented.  
- Assigned caseworker is expected to attend meeting virtually, while designated staff attend in person.    ","Family and Children’s Services of Waterloo Region Foundation, like all charities in Canada, is facing an unprecedented time with the COVID-19 pandemic.   While fundraising in uncertain times is challenging, we will focus our efforts on donor stewardship which will ensure the  foundation  is well positioned for better revenue generation when the crisis is over.  As with other charities, revenue will be impacted and “business as usual” must change and evolve during the pandemic. We have enlisted the support of a fundraising consultant to develop our fundraising strategy focused on the next 4 moths and then for the remainder of the year.
Family and Children’s Services itself, is part of the Region Pandemic planning and is actively working in partnerships  in everything that the  Agency does to deliver services to families during this challenging time. Both the Agency and the Foundation will continue to work with community partners such as  the School Boards, Counseling Agencies, Region of Waterloo Social Services, Women’s Crisis Services, Children’s Mental Health Partners, the police to ensure service continuity. We will also continue to collaborate with other community partners including Adventure4Change, Muslim Social Services, Eritrean Association and other grassroots organizations to assess the needs of vulnerable children, youth and families  including their barriers to  technology (phones, tablets, internet and cellular minutes). The Foundation has committed $20,000 in funding above the $20,000 requested from this grant to address the technology needs of families in contact with FCSWR. Both funds will be in addition to the $50,000 emergency response fund the Foundation is currently distributing to meet the emergency needs of families (e.g., groceries, diapers/wipes/formula, and educational and entertainment for children who are now at home all day instead of school).

This has often meant showing up and doing more. In response to COVID-19, however, it meant closing our physical locations in order to play our part in curbing the spread of this illness.  This has created an opportunity for us to explore ways of showing up even when we cannot meet face-to-face. 

YMCA Health Management programs provide a supportive and welcoming environment for adults with physical and/or psychological obstacles to get started with exercise. We have designed a series of core programs along with a system of long-term supports to ensure participants learn, move and connect for better health. This innovative, collaborative approach addresses chronic disease, improving the health and wellness of older adults across Waterloo Region.

This intervention:
-Engages individuals with modifiable risk factors of chronic disease:  sedentary lifestyle, excess weight, high stress levels, unhealthy eating habits and motivational barriers get started with a healthier lifestyle.
-Engages adults with health challenges that need support to be more active: chronic diseases, mobility challenges, high fall-risk, depression, mental health challenges, isolation, disability, and financial barriers. 
-Supports care partners experiencing social, emotional, and physical stressors resulting from direct, ongoing care for family members
-Creates a community of support and a social support network for participants and their care partners

We remain committed to being here through COVID-19 and beyond.  The impact for our participants in being physically absent from this community is real.  Social connections that exist between participants, staff and volunteers are even more important so we work to remain connected and supportive to this vulnerable community, at this critical time.  While our facilities and programs are closed, we continue to serve this community in new and creative ways.  ",19120,"YMCA Health Management Programs: Enhanced Core Activities for duration of closure and up to 3 months after reopening:

Rock Steady Boxing:  55 participants, 50-85 years of age diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease, Care Partners, 10 volunteers

All Participants with limited training tools & no access to internet will receive a mailing with exercise & strength training handouts and a Theraband for strength training at home.  

Support from the COVID-19 Community Response Fund will be used by the YMCA to enhance YMCA Health Management programs during the pandemic.  The YMCA is taking advantage of the Federal Wage Subsidy program and funds requested will top up staff wages during shut down and additional staffing hours to develop and deliver video content, online classes, and provide 1:1 support.  We do not anticipate a quick return to the YMCA for many of these individuals because of age and existing health concerns; we will continue to provide activities and information virtually to ensure their health and safety.     ","The YMCA Health management staff team provides direct delivery of exercise and education programming to older adults who are at higher risk of developing COVID-19, and are particularly susceptible to the impacts of social isolation and deterioration of physical condition. At this time, it is uncertain when in-person programming will be safe to resume. 

Funds from the COID-19 Community Response Fund will provide the resources to maintain healthy social connections between staff and participants, and cultivate a sense of purpose for our team while we are required to maintain physical distancing now and up to 3 months after re-opening.  Delivering these important services and maintaining these important social connections will positively impact our staff and volunteers, as well as our participants.

YMCA Health Management programs are supported by the dedicated service of 75 volunteers, many of whom are program graduates. These volunteers will be invited to participate in the virtual activities which will also benefit their health and wellbeing during this time. 

During our initial 3 week closure the YMCA continued payment of full salaries and wages for all staff, and maintained health benefits and Employee Assistance Programs.  YMCA leadership has made the decision to move forward with accessing the Federal Governments Wage Subsidy program which will provide 75% of staff salaries to maintain our workforce.  

The YMCA has committed to providing the additional 25%, topping up staff salaries to 100% up to April 17th.  Program and service cancellations and cutbacks where possible on utilities and service contracts have reduced some operational expenses.  Funds from the COVID-19 Community Relief Fund will provide resources needed to continue topping up the salaries of our wellness team to 100% during closure and additional staff hours to continue supporting our vulnerable participants at a distance for up to 3 months upon re-opening. ","The closure of YMCA Health, Fitness and Aquatics Facilities, licensed Child Care Centres and Camps has significantly impacted revenue generation.  Staff payroll was maintained for the first 3 weeks following facility and program shutdowns. Reserve funds have been identified and will be required to bridge operations and support staff until full operations levels are re-established.

Even though our physical doors are closed, we are committed to maintaining the health and wellness of all our people – members, families, volunteers, staff and our community.  
In an effort to be present for those who need us the most, we continue to respond.

Virtual YMCA:  Working in partnership with Communitech, Google, and Vidyard we created and launched ThisIsY.ca, an online hub to keep the community active and engaged even while they practice social distancing. (link here? – unless it is below). Here, all members of our community – members, child care families, staff, volunteers, and even those not previously connected with our programs – can access free resources to fuel their mind, body and spirit during this time. From recipes to activities, group fitness classes and video messages, its one way we’re showing up even while we’re working to flatten the curve.  

Expanding Youth Programs:  Established relationships between youth and a person of trust is critical at this time.  Leveraging technology and social media, we proactively reach out and continue to “meet” with our youth participants online.  Our youth worker “on call” is available daily.  Gender equity in 1:1 conversations is critical for this population to ensure cultural sensitivity.  Youth workers provide information and referrals to youth looking for support, and deliver online workshops and information sessions.

Temporary Shelter:  Working in partnership with the Region of Waterloo, the YWCA and the House of Friendship the A.R Kaufman Family YMCA has been modified to serve as a temporary shelter to protect the most vulnerable in our community from COVID-19.  Currently there are approximately 60 individuals sleeping at the YMCA every night.

With every decision and action we take, we are working to ensure we come out of this as strong as possible.  The cost of responding is real.  Continuing to show up for our community and keeping our people fully employed and working in a time where all of our income sources have evaporated, except for philanthropy is challenging.

While our showing up has started to look a little different in the past couple of weeks, we remain committed to being here for our communities through COVID-19 and beyond. While our facilities and programs may be closed, we are still serving our communities.

We provide an appropriate care setting for those who cannot be cared for in their home, yet do not require/want to be cared for in a hospital setting. We work in collaboration with physicians, hospitals, the local health integration network, and other care providers to offer a range of supportive services that are focused on the residents and their families. This allows for individual choice in determining how to address unique needs and desires for support. Our approach ensures that we can serve diverse communities, respecting the different practical, religious, spiritual and cultural traditions associated with end-of-life care.

We provide an alternative for care to hospitals. Coordination between hospitals and our hospices decreases the number of ER/ALC bed days related to palliative conditions in hospitals. With care provided through residential hospice beds, individuals can access the right care, in the right place, at the right time. We can receive residents directly from the community thereby avoiding hospital admission.  We offer a link between many levels of care – acute, complex, long-term and palliative, providing an opportunity for seamless care across the entire health care system. The result is not only cost effective and efficient; it is also responsive to the individuals served. We allow people the opportunity to spend their last days where they choose, in a caring, home-like setting surrounded by family and friends and supported by compassionate care.

Covid-19 has impacted how we provide care. We must be proactive to ensure our staff and residents do not transmit the virus, at the same time, continue to provide the compassionate care needed. We have added additional safety measures to accomplish this.","$20,000","The health and safety of our residents, their family members, staff and volunteers is of the utmost importance to us.  With the current changing environment, and the potential impact COVID 19 has had on our staff and their ability to care for our vulnerable residents, we have been required to increase the use of personal protection equipment and to ensure all surfaces are continually cleaned and sanitized.

Using PPE amongst all staff, will help staff protect themselves, as well as protect our residents and their families. At the same time, this will allow a family member to continue to visit their loved one prior to their passing.

Adding a disinfection system will help reduce the time needed to clean a room, and allow staff more time to work directly with current residents and their family members, and ensure their needs are well managed. 

How have we reacted to COVID-19 in our community
When community spread was identified in our region we implemented safety measures for our staff, residents and their visiting family members. We had ordered face shields that come below the chin and around to the edge of the ears, these were delayed in getting to us.  As an interim, staff were asked to wear a surgical mask.  Our residents, visitors and staff are screened, however, people have been shown to carry COVID and be asymptomatic.  Putting precautions in place helps to protect staff from visitors and residents as well as protecting staff from each other.  We can not control where/what people do when they are not in the hospice however we can put parameters in place to protect our environment for the staff.  

Our face shields arrived and staff are now asked to wear a face shield through out their shift.  This does not work for everyone.  All face shields are the same size, for people who wear glasses this does not work well and so they have been given the option to wear a mask and their glasses (provided the glasses are kept on through out the day).  For people who are wearing the shield but it does not come below their chin we have also given the option to wear a mask.  On night shift, the staff found the glare on the shield from the lights in the room created a visual barrier, we also have given the option for goggles and mask on this shift.  Gowns were put in place as a measure for staff to protect their clothing and decrease possible transmission from work to home.  At this time we do not have locker areas for staff to change when they arrive and leave their shift.

Our goal is to keep our facility clean.  Public health has said they will not be testing community clients or hospice clients for COVID.  We have taken extra measures to ensure staff safety at work and continue to encourage physical distancing, hand washing and have minimize the foot traffic in our houses.
","We are requesting funding for 2 main safety pieces.

A Nocospray system at each facility.  This is an easy to use portable disinfection system that efficiently kills pathogens on surfaces and in the air. Eliminating what you cannot see is just as important as removing what you can see. Would allow our staff to focus more on our residents and their needs, and ensure all areas are clean and free of contaminants. (50%)

Personal Protection Equipment. Would include surgical masks, N95 masks, face shields, isolation gowns, gloves. This equipment will be worn by all staff members. (50%)
","Lisaard and Innisfree Hospice has a long history- Lisaard House is celebrated it’s 20th year of operation in 2020 and Innisfree House it’s fifth year. We have developed partnerships with the Waterloo Wellington Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), physicians, hospitals, other residential hospices, Conestoga College,  area funeral homes, service clubs and interest groups, and the Waterloo Region community in order to ensure we have the financial support to continue our valuable services.

We recently received accreditation from Hospice Palliatice Care Ontario (HPCO). Accreditation assures the delivery of consistent, high quality hospice palliative care among accredited programs and services located throughout the province. HPCO Accreditation signifies to health professionals, the public and funders that an organization, institution or program is in compliance with industry standards and has been recognized by HPCO based on a rigorous review of overall performance by industry peers. Accreditation also serves as an indicator of commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

The Board of Directors is reviewing the current strategic plan, and will meet in the fall to update the plan.

We are reviewing our fundraising streams to identify shortfalls and adjusting plans for the year. We have implemented several virtual events to help offset cancelled events, and are working with community partners on ways for them to engage their event in new ways (ie virtual)

Everyone is experiencing added stressors to their lives; some people are working the front lines, others have been laid off, some have lost someone to this pandemic, others worry about their own health or that of loved ones, and many more are experiencing a sense of heightened anxiety. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the mental health of many Canadians (http://morneaushepell.mediaroom.com/2020-04-02-Canadians-are-feeling-unprecedented-levels-of-anxiety-according-to-Mental-Health-Index).

Those currently struggling with mental health challenges are particularly vulnerable and it is increasingly important to ensure that everyone gets the mental health support they need.  Providing counselling services at this time, plays an important role in preventing increased demands for intensive treatment and further strain on police and hospital services.

Additionally, the loss of employment experienced by almost half of Canadian households (https://globalnews.ca/news/6726202/coronavirus-canada-job-loss-poll/), means that people will require access to affordable and accessible services. Cost should never be a barrier to getting help. Prior to the pandemic 83% of people seeking counselling at Shalom were not able to cover the cost of the services received and required fee subsidy.  Due to job losses resulting from the pandemic, we are aware that additional subsidies will be required as people will have less capacity to pay for counselling. Supporting people to improve their mental health during this pandemic will develop a more resilient community, better able to respond during this crisis.   We are seeking funding (70% of this ask) to support our ability to subsidize the cost of counselling sessions.","$15,000","The core service that Shalom is providing to the community in this time, is counselling for people experiencing stress, anxiety, depression, trauma, grief and relationship challenges, exacerbated by the pandemic. Shalom’s services are provided on a sliding fee scale according to income, and the reality during this time is that many people have significantly reduced income and rely on these subsidies to receive services. 

Shalom has quickly transformed our services from in-person to online and video counselling, with staff working remotely. This change has increased the need for IT and Admin support to check in and problem-solve issues with counsellors working remotely from their homes. This is an additional, new cost to Shalom. Additional laptop computers are needed to provide adequate technology for all our staff to provide our services.

Working remotely, online and through phone sessions has required additional training for staff, and more frequent availability from the Clinical Director for supervision, reducing the time available for direct service provision.","Shalom is working to provide additional opportunities for staff to connect and check in remotely (daily or every other day), as we are not able to connect in the office. This helps to maintain morale and keep all employees connected to the broader vision and mission of the organization. 

Extra supervision and support time provided by the Clinical Director and Executive Director to support staff in their remote work environments, and talking through clinical questions relating to this new pandemic environment, are activities that directly support the safety, and mental wellness of staff by empowering them to work from a safe location. The wellness of staff relies on the additional support provided by the Clinical Director and Executive Director in this time.

Additional IT and admin support for staff is also allowing them to safely work from their remote environments, and continue to provide services to vulnerable populations. 

Approximately 30% of funding will go to these activities that promote the health and wellness of staff by allowing them to work remotely and continue to have the necessary supports in place to promote their own health and wellbeing. ","Shalom is a member of the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region. The Collaborative is working together to seek funding for continued services. In the meantime, Shalom will continue to monitor cash flow, and could utilize reserve funds as authorized by the Board of Directors. 

Assuming that existing funding partners continue,  the addition of new potential funding sources (such as this request), and existing reserves, Shalom should be able to remain viable over the next 6 months.",https://shalomcounselling.org/sites/default/files/website_files/shalom_2019_annual_report.pdf
4/9/2020 14:38:11,Waterloo Region Family Network,836174052RR0001,Sue Simpson,sue.simpson@wrfn.info,,,"65 Hanson Ave, Kitchener ON N2C2H6",https://www.wrfn.info,"Waterloo Region Family Network (WRFN) helps families with children (all ages) with disabilities; that is exceptional families. WRFN is a peer-developed and peer-driven network helping these families and individuals thrive through making connections in education, community resources and to each other, with no formal diagnosis required and through all life stages.
A consistent schedule is of great importance to exceptional individuals and families. They offer predictability, thus lessening the chance of unknown circumstances that could lead to higher levels of anxiety and confusion. The more predictable a pattern is, the more stable their life. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to a halt these schedules, especially those of students.
Families are now called upon to be the main source of their child’s learning in addition to supporting developmental needs. Access to, and information about, other supports that are being developed as a result of the pandemic is paramount now. WRFN plays a key role in connecting these families. The online availability of our team and the dissemination of information in a way that’s accessible to all is vital during the pandemic. 
Given the recent order for citizens to remain in their homes and only venture out for necessities, social isolation is creating the need for virtual activities that will lessen the negative effects of quarantining. No contact with one’s usual social support can have many negative effects. This is especially true for exceptional individuals and within their families. Creating opportunities for interaction with others – even virtually – is an important tool in combating loneliness and ensuing difficulties. The unique placement of WRFN - its staff and programs - in the context of community services makes it an ideal resource to help combat the consequences of isolation that is of an uncertain length of time.
","$15,000","The core activities of WRFN for which funding will be needed are for staffing costs, overhead (enhanced IT), and capacity building support. WRFN is built on a strong partnership model with over 10 community service members and three associate members who share a common vision for family support. Our collaborative approach capitalizes on the sharing of resources between multiple organizations and families.  In order to sustain this model, resources for online delivery will be needed including enhanced IT support and subscriptions for video conferencing and other services including possible new equipment capable of handling the added stress put on older models currently in use.
The service system for people with disabilities and their families can be daunting.  Knowing what services are available and how to access them is challenging.  It is easy to understand why people feel overwhelmed.   The benefit of having an organization like WRFN, with staff members and volunteers who can guide families on their journey, makes a big difference.  
Staffing cost to run and deliver programs without interruption is another expense for which funding will be needed. The seamless delivery of programs to our clients, albeit in an altered format, is of the utmost importance to them. Individuals and families participating in our programs have come to depend upon the assistance they can gain through attendance. 
These programs include social events such as our Coffee Club,  offering connection with others and an opportunity to share experiences. Our Parent Mentor Program offers information and emotional support where volunteer parent mentors can share ideas and strategies connecting mentees with community resources. Similarly, our Family Resource Program offers help in navigating local services and resources available to people with disabilities and their families. The opportunity to learn from a fellow exceptional adult is gained through WRFN’s Ask a Self-Advocate where lived experiences and lessons are shared. Successful collaboration between home and school, involving transparent and open communication, can be the key to a student’s success. We help facilitate the process through our school issues support group.
The delivery of these programs by our knowledgeable team, brings the continuity and stability needed into the lives of many exceptional individuals and families. These groups meet regularly and offer much needed guidance, emotional support, and companionship to exceptional individuals and families. The pandemic does not remove the need for these benefits, it increases it. They can still be obtained virtually through online delivery of the programs which will help to ease the burden of social isolation in a time of great anxiety.  

WRFN is looking into assistance available through the Federal Wage Subsidy program. However,  guidelines for registered charities are not yet fully clear.  Updates continue to be shared with some details to be worked out.  It’s difficult to know if our funding will meet the requirements as each month for small organizations like WRFN, will look different. We are exploring this option as new information becomes available. 

","The stress of the unorthodox working situation is not lost upon the Board or Executive Director. Staff is all working remotely and our volunteers have also been forced to rethink their roles and to be creative in how they fulfill them. All are being directly supported by Sue Simpson, founder and Executive Director of Waterloo Region Family Network on a weekly, if not daily, basis. Connections are made through calls, emails and virtual platforms. 
Further support such as counselling and social work for staff and volunteers, if required, will be provided through resources being made available through fellow non-profits at no cost. The well-being of our team – staff and volunteers – is paramount. As is that of board members.  Contact between the Board Chair and Executive Director occurs multiple times per week to ensure all are doing well and are appropriately supported. 
10% of funding requested will be dedicated to the above support. 
","Waterloo Region Family Network’s 11- person Board of Directors is a highly involved and motivated one. They are invested in, and devoted to, the success of WRFN. Regular board meetings and committee meetings will continue to be held virtually without interruption and their advice and counsel will continue to create dynamic leadership and support for WRFN.
WRFN was born of partnerships. And these have only strengthened in the past 10+ years of our existence. Given that the pandemic is increasingly calling for inventive solutions and new partnerships in order to deliver services, WRFN is ahead of the curve.
The agencies supporting children, youth, adults and families in Waterloo Region work together to sustain Waterloo Region Family Network.  The partners understand that alone, no one agency can do the work of WRFN.  Families are well served when WRFN is able to help them strengthen and gain personal capacity and resiliency.  
Recently, WRFN has been renewing all of its existing partnerships, with the commensurate financial commitment and participation commitment  from each partner, and is on solid ground with these organizations that have helped to support one of the most successful and heavily-called upon agencies in the region. The communication and sharing of information and best practices with our partners will continue throughout the pandemic and in the following months. Regular meetings will occur and, where necessary, additional meetings will take place. In addition, creative and innovative solutions to problems presented by social isolation and quarantine will continue to be sought and explored to ensure all family needs are met during the current crisis and in the months following. 
The Waterloo Region Family Network is well connected to families with varying needs and understands firsthand the challenges they face. This puts the WRFN in a unique position to provide insights into service delivery organizations and community planning tables.  Whether it’s WRFN staff with lived experience or parent mentors, having a direct connection with organizations and planning groups allows services to be shaped in a way that better meets families’ needs.  
The community planning tables will now be virtual but will continue. Included in this planning is a refreshed relationship with both the Waterloo Region District School Board and the Waterloo Catholic District School Board to better support families and students in the months ahead.  The planning of a virtual school support workshop to be co-facilitated by the superintendents of the both school boards, with participation by parents will inject new energy into these relationships as we explore the new ways of learning.

4/9/2020 15:00:35,Kitchener Downtown Community Health Centre,BN 86771 9437 RR0001,Elizabeth Beader,ebeader@kdchc.org,,,44 Francis Street South Kitchener Ontario N2G 2A2,http://kdchc.org/,"Phase 1 of an agreement effective April 1, 2020, between KDCHC and Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre  provides for the sharing of administrative resources.  SRHC serves refugee newcomers.  The model of care provides a continuum that supports the re-settlement needs of this refugee newcomer population. It is based on a gradual transition process whereby those patients who no longer need the specialized services offered at SRHC can be served at KDCHC and assisted in accessing the community programs offered there to other immigrants similarly adjusting to the systems and challenges of life in Canada.  SRHC has more than 5,000 patients on its roster. These are people who came to Canada as refugees under sponsorship agreements/seeking asylum.  They are drawn from countries where conflict, war and oppression have forced them from their homes.  Many have spent years in refugee camps where disease and malnutrition has resulted in chronic conditions that put them especially at risk during the COVID-19 pandemic.  This population is predominantly under 20, mostly women of child bearing years and some 350 new births projected in 2020.  Households are used to living in community and sharing limited resources.  It is imperative that these patients continue to have access to trauma informed and culturally sensitive care and health education offered in languages with which they are familiar if they are to comply with public health recommendations and stay free of the virus.  This need has necessitated the hiring of an additional person to take incoming calls, a person who has appropriate language skills and is medically trained to triage needs, provide basic education and advice on COVID-19 protocols and to identify those in greatest need of physician intervention.  This new position was not in the original KDCHC budget for the support of SRHC. ","$20,000","The position for which funds are needed may be described under that of “Special” Provider/Patient Support Administrator. It is an additional position to cope with the expanded role made necessary by the pandemic.  The Patient/Provider Administrator position (description attached) is essential to the care and support offered at SRHC where some 110 patients are seen daily at the clinic.  Many patients attend by appointment but just as many arrive as walk-ins because making and keeping appointments is alien in many of the cultures from which refugees come.  While everyday health care needs still require attention and cannot be ignored, it is necessary that those with symptoms associated with COVID-19 are discouraged from coming to the clinic.  Some will come anyway and must be screened and advised what to do, where to go.  
The protocol now in place requires that 
•	All calls from patients at home seeking appointments are asked relevant questions to determine their immediate needs. 
Those with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 are referred to a provider for advice by this special worker. 
If a provider is not immediately available, she will ensure that a provider will call back in a timely manner and advise the caller of what can be expected.
•	Those patients who come to the clinic are screened at the entrance for temperature and other symptoms that would necessitate their being isolated while waiting to be seen by a provider.
•	Following the physician’s consultation, provider/patient support includes: 
Faxing prescriptions and ensuring that the pharmacy can get medications to a patient.  
If the patient is to go for further assessment at one of the COVID-19 clinics, contacting Public Health 
Facilitating the patient’s understanding of the situation and what to do. 

Language skills and a culturally sensitive medical background are essential to this role.  For many patients who have come from refugee experiences, the pandemic is a trigger for anxiety which can be displayed in many ways including shortness of breath, a symptom known to be a feature of COVID-19.  SRHC has been fortunate to employ the services of an Arabic speaking International Nursing Graduate already familiar with the clinic.
While routine provider/patient support can sometimes be offered by workers from home, this position requires being at the clinic. (370 words)
","Refugee Newcomer patients have many health concerns some of which are exacerbated by the pandemic.  Many have respiratory issues and concerns which make them particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.  Infants and children continue to experience childhood complaints and a 6th month old infant with a high temperature must be seen by a physician promptly; pregnant women must be examined routinely.  Difficulties arising from the public health directives for physical distancing contribute to the enhanced potential for domestic abuse of adults and children many of whom live in precarious housing situations not suitable for the number of people in a household. Mental health concerns triggered by anxiety and previous trauma cannot be ignored.
These refugee newcomer patients are vulnerable people who must be protected from COVID-19.  The service providers go home to their families and must minimize the possibility of community spread of the virus.  The protocols that have been put in place and are made possible by this additional provider/patient support position protect the safety and well-being of patients and their families and providers and their families.  
It is significant that the creation of this position has enabled the capacity of the clinic overall to maintain service to 85% patients who would typically have been seen at the clinic on a daily basis. While anecdotally it is thought that the number of “walk-ins” is reduced by some 30%, and the data shows that almost 40% of patients seeking appointments are now being seen virtually.  
Everyone, patients and staff would be at risk if even one presumptive case were not dealt with properly.  It is a tribute to the process and those responsible at the clinic that to date only one patient has tested positive for the virus and that patient did not actually visit the clinic.
The salary of this additional full time provider/patient support administrator is consistent with others holding similar positions.  It is $20/hour.   It is anticipated that the position will be necessary at least until the end of August.  At that time the incumbent will have been in place for 6 months for a total salary of $19,500.00. The full amount of $20,000.00 is requested, the $500.00 balance being needed to cover the cost of additional personal protective equipment for use by this worker. 

 
","A new collaborative relationship between KDCHC and SRHC has been in discussion for almost a year.  The Boards of the two organizations have negotiated a mutually beneficial long term agreement which was signed in March, 2020 and began to be implemented on April 1.  Phase 1 includes significant sharing of administrative resources primarily in the human resources area.  Part of this recognizes additional administrative needs for the support of the work done at SRHC that has expanded to meet the continuing demand from those newcomers arriving from refugee experiences.

These two organizations hold common objectives for meeting the health care needs of vulnerable people from the perspective disease prevention and health promotion.  While the focus of SRHC is acute needs arising from refugee trauma, experience and culture shock, KDCHC has the ability to help those refugees who demonstrate readiness to access mainstream health and community resources and learn how to navigate the systems so that they can be fully well and responsible Canadians.

4/9/2020 15:12:20,Community Support Connections , #12962-1298-RR0001,Will Pace,willp@cscmow.org,Rosalind Horne,rosalindh@cscmow.org,61 Woolwich Street N,https://communitysupportconnections.org/,"The most urgent need is for local seniors and adults with disabilities who are not able to access the nutrition they need to stay healthy and at home. Our existing clients are unable to get out to the grocery store or prepare food for themselves, either due to a pre-existing condition or circumstance. We are also seeing an increasing number of clients who either now need our services, or who need to rely more heavily on our services, because they are now unable to get out due to the significant risk to seniors from COVID-19. Whereas these clients previously had other informal supports in the community through neighbours or friends, physical distancing and quarantine protocols now prevent them from receiving those supports. 

Our services mitigate risks around food insecurity for clients by delivering food to their doors, through newly developed and tested no-contact delivery methods, whether for prepared meals or groceries. Our Meals on Wheels program typically serves isolated and homebound individuals, or people who face physical limitations, frailty, or cognitive issues, and includes weekday delivery of nutritious meals, with a valuable safety check at the door. Last year, across all of our services, 74% of our 7,667 clients were over the age of 70, including 16 who were 100 years old or more.

Likewise, our grocery shopping program sees agency personnel obtain and deliver groceries right to clients’ homes. We are currently not driving clients to the store, but are picking up their groceries and are delivering to them. We are seeking to expand our capacity to respond and sustain our services as we are seeing an increased need from local seniors during this pandemic period.
",20000,"Adapting our services to respond to current health directives, while facing an increased demand for our services, presents an array of resource management challenges relating to operational overhead, volunteer management, and maintaining safety standards for our personnel. We are unable to access federal wage subsidies as 70% of our funding is stable through the Ministry of Health.
Overhead - Traditionally, our Meals on Wheels service has relied on community partner sites, which serve as localized pick-up depots for our delivery areas. Drivers log their route mileages daily, so we can offer reimbursements for their travel expenses and reduce financial barriers to volunteering with us. Through the efficiency of the depot system, we were able to greatly reduce costs, with some depots saving us upwards of $15,000 each annually in mileage reimbursements. With all community locations closed, anyone delivering Meals on Wheels now meets at our Breslau location to receive their routes for Cambridge, Kitchener, North Dumfries, and Waterloo. The current suspension of the depot system is therefore resulting in a significant increase in operating costs, at a time when the necessity of the service has become all the more urgent.
Volunteer Management - Many of our traditional volunteers are seniors themselves, and are not able to continue delivering presently. This has left noticeable personnel gaps that must otherwise be filled by staff. Over the last few weeks this has led to 50 hours a day in staff time totalling $1,000 a week. We are actively increasing recruitment and onboarding efforts, targeting out-of-the-workplace, working-age volunteers to provide replacement personnel with great success of over 60 new volunteer applications in a single five day period. However, this necessitates the ability to screen, interview, onboard, and train a large quantity of volunteers within a very short period of time, all of which must be done without direct, in-person contact. Support in accessing the paid features of digital media services, such as Vidyard (a locally-based video-content facilitator), will greatly assist in volunteer coordination processes, allowing us to produce effective, customizable video content, that are both easily developed and adaptable as health directives are updated. This content will eliminate the need for individual volunteer training sessions, allowing us to process a greater number of volunteers within a shorter timeframe, while respecting physical distancing protocols. 
Health, Wellness, and Safety of Staff and Volunteers - New operational protocols mandated by health advisories place an additional burden on the cost to operate our services, as greater investments in health and safety equipment are now required. Portable hand sanitizer dispensers and disinfectant wipes, now must be obtained in greater quantities, and restocked regularly. As part of our new Meals on Wheels delivery safety protocols, conscious efforts to mitigate the risk of person-to-person contact require us to invest in additional materials, such as single-use bags to hang meals to the clients’ doors. These increased costs will only compound as our services expand, and pandemic protocols persist over the coming months.
","Consistent with current health directives we have implemented revised health and safety protocols for all volunteers and staff. These protocols guideline the use of disinfectant materials, including hand sanitizer and sanitary wipes, provided for each delivery driver to cleanse their vehicles and equipment, as well as their hands throughout their exposure to buildings and public spaces. In addition, one single-use bag per client must also be issued, used to transport meals from thermal bags to attach to the clients’ doors, to mitigate the risk of person-to-person contact. Furthermore, as some agency drivers operate an agency-owned vehicle, those vehicles must be thoroughly cleansed between each shop or meal route, at a cost of $600 in unfunded staff time per week.

In addition, we have restricted access to our office for all but a handful of employees who otherwise are unable to work from home, and require access to materials within our office structure. These staff also require quantities of sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, to regularly cleanse their workstations and high touch surfaces. The office space itself requires more frequent general cleaning, to further reduce the risk of viral propagation. The increased level of enhanced cleaning and sanitizing of our office spaces results in an additional expenditure of $620 per week.

Our staff are taking clients’ grocery lists over the phone for us to purchase online on their behalf when possible to save our drivers’ time, or receive a list over the phone to send to our drivers using our app. This eliminates one unnecessary trip to the clients’ homes, so drivers only need to drop their food off. We are currently doing between eight and ten shops a day, and with an increase in time due to line-ups to both get into stores, as well as to pay, every shop is taking twice as long as previously with an increased cost of $2,000 each week to our agency that we are not passing onto clients. By not taking clients we are not only increasing protection of our seniors, but our staff by avoiding close proximity within a vehicle.

To ensure these services are financially accessible to anyone who needs them, they are offered on a sliding scale based on client income to ensure affordability.

These safety measures account for 64% of our request to cover one month’s time.

Before every shift, whether coming into our kitchen, office, or before providing service, all volunteers and staff must clear a health and travel screener provided by Ministry of Health before starting. We also previously invited staff to identify if they have an underlying medical condition so we could ensure appropriate accommodations are in place, with an ongoing invitation for staff to come forward at any time if their situation or comfort level changes. 
","We are fortunate that about 70% of our funding comes from the Ministry of Health, and remains stable as we’re working to keep people healthy in their homes, helping divert people from inappropriate and unnecessary trips to the hospital and long term care. We did invite staff to let us know if it was their preference to receive a temporary layoff at this time, with about a quarter of our staff (mostly casual, part time) indicating their preference to do so based on their own personal situations. With 70% of our funding stable, we also see revenues from community donations and grants. While most of our services are free, for some there is a fee for service based on client income. For fee for service programs, revenues are continuing as these services are continuing. 

We have also been in touch with Bingemans who prepared our Meals on Wheels for years before we had our own kitchen, and who have offered to help if we hit a point in time when our kitchen has to shut down temporarily, or if we run into issues with suppliers. While we continue to operate our own kitchen, we are also preparing and building an inventory of frozen meals in our own kitchen in case of shortages from our suppliers.

Not only from the stress of managing the care of ill patients and the anticipated death rates, but the stress put on their own families and their safety and security. 

Local leadership at hospitals, primary care and other first responders contacted CMHA WW and requested support for the mental trauma and stress that will be faced by front line health care workers during the COVID19 Crisis.  Responding to this request, CMHA in partnership with our community has created a prioritized service pathway to provide free, immediate mental health care to front line healthcare workers.

The pathway prioritizes health care workers and links them to free psychiatry, psychotherapy, support groups, and online virtual care and resources.  The here4healthcare.ca website is the front door to care, and a new online resource library available anytime.  

Prioritized services has created in partnership with the Counselling Collaborative of Waterloo Region (a network of counselling services including Carizon, Interfaith Counselling Centre, Family Counselling of Cambridge and North Dumfries, KW Counselling, Shalom Counseling and Woolwich Counselling Centre) ; Family Counselling and Support Services of Wellington-Dufferin; Broadleaf Services; University of Guelph; and a number of private psychiatrists and psychologists.

This did not include the work of Christian Horizons, as we are an essential service provider for people who experience disabilities. The people in our communities depend on the supports and services we provide. In the Region of Waterloo, we’re currently providing direct supports to 52 people living with a disability in 9 community residences and 12 Supported Independent Living homes. This rewarding work requires the effort of over 116 Direct Support Professionals.

We have closed our non-essential services and diverted every energy to our various residential supports, focusing on the health and well-being of the people who use these services and our staff. As of this week, we have begun to hear that some of our employees and supported individuals are now testing positive for COVID-19. 

Outside of Christian Horizons, we are connecting with sector leaders, government and political officials, and public health authorities at every level. We are trying to ensure our employees and the work we do is considered with the same focus as health care, so we can also get priority access to personal protective equipment and access to expedited COVID-19 testing for people we support and the employees who support them.

COVID-19 has potentially disproportionate impacts on vulnerable groups, including people with disabilities. People with disabilities have higher incidences of chronic or co-occurring health conditions. Patients with disabilities who test positive for COVID-19 face increased risk of discrimination and isolation during this pandemic. For example, the new rule that family members and others who assist people with disabilities may not be allowed in the hospital with them, isolates these people more and can make it harder for them to get through this time.
","$20,000","Christian Horizons will continue to provide support to people who experience disabilities. Some of our supports include Community residences. Community residences provide residential settings for adults, who require assistance in daily living. Generally, in this type of setting two to six people share a home or apartment and have access to Direct Personal Support 24 hours per day. 

We also have Supported Independent Living services. Supported Independent Living is an option for a person who chooses to live independently or with a house mate. The level of support is determined on an individual basis and can range from several hours per day to several hours each week. Christian Horizons provides person directed supports that assist people in community and supported residences in multiple ways including carrying out therapeutic routines, addressing medical needs, and personal care.

Christian Horizons employs Direct Support Professionals to work in our Community residences and to provide our Supported Independent Living services. These employees require skills, experience, competencies and educational qualifications to deliver effective supports. In order for them to continue to do their job effectively and safely during this pandemic, they need personal protective equipment to maintain their health and the health of the people they support. 

For example, currently in the Waterloo region we have 4 individuals we support that require aerosol generating procedures. This will require 67 of our Direct Support Professionals to be fitted and protected with N95 masks to care safely for these individuals.","As I mentioned above, we have closed our non-essential services and diverted every energy to our various residential supports, focusing on the health and well-being of the people who choose our services and our employees. As of this week, we now have positive cases for COVID-19 of both our staff and supported individuals.

We have laid out new guidelines in our residences and support service locations to implement new measures for health and safety in the homes to protect our employees and the people they support. These measures include an increase use of personal protective equipment. These increased measures have depleted our stock of personal protective equipment. So we continue to search for ways to replenish our stock of goggles, gowns, gloves, masks and supplies of hand sanitizer and thermometers.

When a care provider is conducting support in the home of someone who is a suspected or a confirmed case for COVID-19, our Direct Support Professionals will take additional precautions. These precautions include wearing appropriate personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, masks and eye protection. The supported individual will also need to wear a mask (if tolerated) while the worker is providing support during this time.

One hundred percent of this funding request will go toward purchasing personal protective equipment.","Christian Horizons serves people across Ontario and Saskatchewan. We continue to maintain strong connections within the Developmental Services sector. This includes being a founding and voting member of the Provincial Network on Developmental Services in Ontario as well as having a strong relationship with the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services. 

We are participating daily in the Ministry of Health Emergency Operation Centre’s update calls on COVID-19 and have significant action plans in place. We have worked to build strategies and preparedness around outbreak scenarios. Action plans are ready in case of an outbreak within our organization.","

As a result of the COVID 19 pandemic many youth are feeling alone, confused and emotionally it is a difficult situation for them to navigate. They now no longer have the support of their peers, teachers or the school system and feel like they are isolated during this time. They are lacking the support they need to manage their worries and anxieties about what is happening in the world. Without the proper emotional support during this time many of the youth we serve will suffer with their mental health issues alone. 

Currently our agency is facing many urgent/emerging needs. We have had a drastic drop in our revenue due to the cancellation of one of our major fundraising events that was to take place on April 6th, 2020. This affects the ability for our agency to move forward during these challenging times which is why we are requesting support to help cover our overhead costs such as rent, administrative expenses and staffing costs. Another challenge our agency is facing is moving all of our programs online so that we can still provide mentoring support to the children and youth in need. We are in need of expanding our IT infrastructure to be able to move all programs online and build the capacity of our programs to still be able to operate. ","$15,000","The first core activity we are seeking funding for is related to staffing costs. Due to the loss of revenue we are experiencing with fundraising events being cancelled and a drop in donations we need support to continue to pay staff into the next months and continue to operate our programs. At this point our organization is hopeful that we will be able to take advantage of the federal wage subsidy program but with the applications and final details not fully released yet we are unsure. These funds will support the payment of our program coordinators and allow us to continue offer our services during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
The other core activity we need support with is our overhead costs. With the drop in revenue we have experiences it will be difficult for our agency to continue operating and maintaining our over head costs such as rent, administrative costs such as phone bills and IT expenses incurred to have all our staff work remotely from home.

Another core activity we are seeking funding support for if moving all of our mentoring programs onto an online format so we can continue to support the children in our programs during this time. We are in need of expanding our IT infrastructure to be able to move all programs online and build the capacity of our programs to still be able to operate. This will include finding new secure video chat apps, working with the school board on the new process and policy for support children, find ways to facilitate our group mentoring programs remotely, pivoting our programs activities to be easily run from home and redeveloping the way we screen, train and onboard volunteers to be all remotely. These new online systems will have to also allow us to screen, interview and train new families that are requesting our services. 

Our agency is requesting funds for the above core activities so that we can ensure we are able to support local children and youth in need and continue to offer our services. Without supports our agency will have a difficult maintaining our services in the future and having the ability to provide the crucial mentoring support many children need now more than ever. 
","Moving all of our programs online allow us to maintain the health and safety of our staff, volunteers and children that we serve. This will allow us to continue to support the wellness of local children and youth in need while also ensuring that everyone can stay safe and following the guidelines set out by Region of Waterloo Public health. All of the activities listed above allow us to maintain the wellness of our volunteers, staff and the children/families we work with as it allows our agency to continue operating and providing financial support to our staff, emotional and mental health supports to the children and families and supports to our volunteers to help them navigate working with their Mentee during these difficult times. ","At this time our team and board and still working through all the changes and information that is coming out with COVID-19. From a fundraising perspective we are currently having conversations with all our funders and are looking at ways that we can move cancelled events to an online format or reschedule events to a later date.  We are also looking at fundraising campaigns we can run now online to get the support from our donors to move forward with our programs. Our board is in the midst of creating a plan in terms of finances and staffing over the next 6 months and working out plans with multiple scenarios and time frames. At this time we have tried to freeze all spending we can and are only focusing on the payment of our essential bills that will not affect the vitality of our organization in the future. Again at this time there is so much unknown and the timing of how long we will be in this situation is unknown that we do not have one plan we are focused on as we are still learning about our options to move forward into the future. 

We are currently in conversations with our National office as well as other Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies across Canada to learn how we can share resources during this time and learn some successes and challenges agencies are facing with moving their mentoring programs to online formats. Then end goal that both our staff and board want to work toward is securing enough funding to ensure that we can continue to provide our crucial mentoring programs to local children in need and be there for them when they need us most.

Isolation and anxiety is increasing as the health care system turns its full attention to the demands of the pandemic.   Home supports for these patients are being reduced as health care workers are re-deployed to other duties and with social distancing no face to face hospice service is occurring including visits, transportation, day programs, support groups, etc.   Supports for these families is vitally important at this time, so that caregivers are equipped to remain at home and care for their dying loved one, without needing to access emergency departments or acute care.

Additionally, the need for practical resources is becoming a new and increasing need.   For our clients who are in a lower socio-economic demographic, they are extremely limited in the community resources they can access.  Food security, access to medications, opportunities for counselling and social interactions with others are very limited.   We are currently paying for Meals on Wheels for three clients so that they can have one hot meal each day.  These are sick individuals who do not have a caregiver in the home and who are unable to cook for themselves.  With reduced PSW supports coming in, being able to heat a meal is their only option.   We also have a client who is receiving a clinical trial treatment for cancer at Princess Margaret in Toronto with no way to travel to appointments.  With social distancing, volunteer drivers are not an option so taxi transport is needed for him to continue treatment.

Because the population we serve is often elderly, ill and with limited ability to access resources, we expect that these types of situations will continue and increase as the pandemic response extends for further weeks.
","$18,000","•	Emergency stabilization for food security – currently paying Meals of Wheels to deliver frozen meals to three ill individuals who are too sick to cook for themselves and who require at least a minimum of one meal per day
•	Emergency transportation support – need to hire secure transportation once every two weeks to take an ill individual to Princess Margaret hospital for clinical trial treatments for cancer.
•	Staffing costs for expanded system navigation activities to connect clients with the community resources they require
•	Staffing costs for expanded counselling services to increase the amount of time available for telephone support to those isolated at home
•	Staffing costs for expanded web and social media activity for those who can access caregiver supports, providing information, resources and activities to maintain their well being.  

Currently working with our auditors to determine our ability to claim the Federal Wage Subsidy programs.   Our ability to participate in this program is unknown at this time.

Our organization is currently reviewing fundraising strategies for the next year in light of the extended period where fundraising is not able to continue.   Because these services are an integral part of our ability to fully support individuals and families at end of life, there is an urgency to ensuring that we can continue to offer them and in creating the long term plan that will allow for that.",http://www.hospicewaterloo.ca/about-us/reports-accreditations/

 A Mental Health services provider at Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre (SRHC) reports that in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are cases of families who are feeling re-traumatized by what they perceive as imposed curfews vs quarantine. Some of our patients come from countries where people get killed if they leave their homes during curfews. The association of lived traumatic experience and the current emotional condition created by the COVID-19 can seriously affect refugee newcomers families and may make their home an unpleasant place to stay in. Also, children may be at a higher risk of experiencing maltreatment and domestic violence during the COVID-19. 

Additionally, families with a refugee background typically face cultural and linguistic barriers, which may limit their access to quality information about the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, many families are uncertain about how to access health care. During their virtual outreach, the service providers at SRHC have noted that some families are under-utilising health care services and/or are not contacting their health care providers when they fall sick. To help its patients positively cope with the pandemic, SRHC would like to boost its mental health and education services and ensure that its patients, particularly the new to Canada refugee newcomer families, get through the COVID-19 pandemic safely.

","$19,992","Due to the nature of the clientele at Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre, we anticipate the need to provide intentional counselling and mental health support in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, we plan to provide 50-minute counselling sessions via telephone services with translation services also provided. We will recruit 4 counsellors to speak with 7 clients per day. We will target around 560 clients due to capacity and funding limitations, between May 2020 and June 2020. This will greatly enhance the mental health service delivery and provide much needed data on how well our clients’ families are coping since they have a complicated background of unplanned resettlement due to tumultuous circumstances often with unaddressed trauma and mental health disorders accompanying them. The data will inform best practices in providing quality mental health services in future.

A summary of planned activities is as follows:
- Provide counselling related to mental health issues via telephone with translation services provided to Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre clients
     Check-in/screening for domestic violence via telephone with translation services provided
- On-call service to provide mental health support to clients via telephone with translation services provided during the weekend
- Provide tips on COVID-19, self-care to boost mental health and for healthy (positive) parenting adapted from the WHO and UNICEF
- Translate the tips into the main spoken languages among the clients of Arabic, Tigrinya, Somali, Spanish, and Turkish. French will also be added in line with the Canadian context.
- Online dissemination of information to clients using different media and digital platforms
- Liaising with other mental health organisations on referrals based on the outcomes of the counselling sessions
- Tracking the impact for monitoring and evaluation with follow-up sessions during and after the intervention (mid-May 2020 and end June 2020).
- Project report to be prepared in July 2020
","Our main service delivery will be done without physical contact and to that extent, the providers will be protected from any COVID-19 transmissions.

We will provide paid 10-minute breaks between calls and 1-hour long lunch breaks to safeguard the nutritional and mental well-being of the providers. 
","A new collaborative relationship between Kitchener Downtown Community Health Centre (KDCHC) and Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre (SRHC)has been in discussion for almost a year. The Boards of the two organizations have negotiated a mutually beneficial long-term agreement which was signed in March 2020 and began to be implemented on April 1st, 2020. These two organizations hold common objectives for meeting the health care needs of vulnerable people from the perspective of disease prevention and health promotion. While the focus of SRHC is acute needs arising from refugee trauma, experience and culture shock, KDCHC has the ability to help those refugees who demonstrate readiness to access mainstream health and community resources and learn how to successfully navigate the systems in Canada. 

SRHC will collaborate with the University of Waterloo (Department of Psychology, Whole Family Lab) to produce an article based on the data collected during the COVID-19 mental health project to inform a wider audience on best practices and lessons learned from the project. A plan for further collaborations on mental health promotion projects is in place.

There is a strong possibility of working with the Canadian Mental Health Association to boost the mental health services at Sanctuary Refugee Health Centre, based on the lessons that will be gleaned from the project.

We currently need additional staff to support youth who are now remaining on site during the day due to COVID-19 social distancing and “stay at home” protocols. This creates additional costs for staffing as well as the need for extra Personal Protective Equipment. 

Safe Haven offers immediate admission to our shelter on a 24 hour/7 day a week basis to youth that are experiencing a crisis and need a safe place to stay. The crisis facing these youth is often due to family conflict and during this time of COVID-19, stresses within families are particularly high. The impact on youth mental health is significant and Safe Haven provides a safe and supportive environment for youth. Staff listen to concerns and help them to process information in a way that is meaningful, supportive and anxiety-reducing. 

While our programs encourage youth to be out looking for work or going to school during the day, because of the need to stay at home to reduce the spread of COVID-19, they are now remaining at Safe Haven all day adding to stresses and increasing demand on staff.

No matter which service they are accessing, youth need a safe and caring place. With the pandemic, Safe Haven has become an even more important resource for vulnerable youth in our community. In order to provide good and safe care, we need make sure that we are staffed appropriately, have enough food , have extra cleaning supplies to sanitize the building and common touch points, and PPE for staff to minimize the spread of the virus. This all results in operating costs that are above and beyond our current budget.
","$20,000","Recently, the Ontario Ministry of Health released Covid-19 Guidelines for Homeless Shelters. These guidelines outline how Homeless Shelters can help plan for, prevent, and manage symptoms of COVID-19.  As Safe Haven implements these recommendations, it comes at a cost for products and staff time.

Staffing:
Safe Haven Youth Shelter is open 24 hours/7 days a week for admissions.  Typically, during the school year Safe Haven has youth in their care afterschool, overnight and on the weekends. While there are licensing requirements that dictate minimum staff to youth ratios, due to the current stay at home protocol Safe Haven Youth Services has brought in extra staff for 5 shifts a week to provide extra support. Physical distancing guidelines have also introduced a need for extra staff as we try to keep youth in smaller groups and further apart from each other. Staff have also been completing the extra cleaning and disinfecting that needs to occur throughout the facility.  

Federal Wage Subsidy programs: Lutherwood has reviewed all of the programs offered by the government to help cover the cost of extra staffing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the current eligibility criteria, we are not eligible at this time.

Cleaning products:
Safe Haven has professional cleaners who clean on a regular basis. However, responding to more stringent cleaning and disinfecting protocols required during COVID-19, staff are cleaning common touch points more frequently in addition to the regular cleaning service. As hand washing and sanitizing practices have increased, hand sanitizer and hand soap is being used at a higher rate. Adding to our expenses, we are now seeing an increase in the costs of cleaning products and hand sanitizer.

Personal Protective Equipment:
Safe Haven Youth Services is seeing an increase in need for PPE. While we have always stocked PPE for staff use, the rate at which it is being accessed has increased dramatically during the current pandemic.  Here we have been fortunate to work with community organizations to acquire donations or be able to purchase PPE for our staff throughout all of our essential services.

Food:
Safe Haven Youth Shelter is developing a contingency plan should limited food bank services impact the food that is available to our youth. This hasn’t happened yet, but in the event that it does, the shelter will need to be prepared to provide three meals a day seven days a week to the youth who are residing in the shelter. Safe Haven Shelter depends on donations from the Food Bank to offset our food costs throughout the year. Last year, we were able to keep our annual food expenditures below $500. However, with the increased demand on their supplies the food bank is unable to maintain supply, it will have a great impact on our budget, and we will need financial donations to make up the difference. 
","By far, our largest COVID-19 expense is the salary cost of bringing in additional staff to keep our clients and staff safe. Outside of this, the activity that focuses solely on the health, wellness and safety of the staff is the purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). We are also seeking funding for cleaning supplies which are in the best interest of everyone’s wellbeing.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):
The purchase of additional PPE will support the health, wellness and safety of the staff who are working at Safe Haven Shelter. The COVID-19 guidelines from the Ministry of Health indicates that PPE for shelters focuses on gloves and masks with masks only being used during intakes if there is not a plexiglass divider used during the intake process. Staff need to have ongoing access to appropriate PPE during a pandemic for their own safety. As part of their role, staff are interacting regularly with youth in the common room during recreation time and in kitchen and dining areas during meal times to name two examples. Therefore, we must always have a healthy supply of PPE for our staff. However, due to the increased usage of PPE there is an extra expense that was not built into the budget.  The additional cost will come at a cost to the youth programs if we cannot find other means to offset this expense. The percentage of the money requested that will go solely towards the staffs’ health, wellness and safety is 1% for the purchase of PPE.

Staffing:
The addition of one extra staff for 5 shifts a week will allow staff the opportunity to more easily divide the group into smaller numbers to reinforce physical distancing.  This impacts staff health and wellness as staff can know that they aren’t putting anyone in harm’s way by having too many people in the same area or too close to each other. Additional staff also allows staff to better divide tasks and take on additional cleaning responsibilities rather than try and do everything by themselves. This is about 98% of the cost of this request for support.

To further reduce the likelihood of cross-site contamination, we have stopped the movement of staff between sites in our organization. This however, can limit the number of staff available to work at one place. Elsewhere within Lutherwood, we have moved as many of our staff as possible to work from home including staff in our Employment, Housing, Community Mental Health Services and administration. However, this is not an option for Safe Haven staff.

Cleaning Supplies:
The purchase of additional cleaning supplies will allow staff to keep the shelter clean and disinfected for the youth and themselves. This will ultimately ensure that no one becomes ill from touching a surface that may have been contaminated. Again this is less than 1% of the overall cost of this ask, but it is a need.

","Lutherwood has always been careful to balance short-term operating needs with prudent long-term business management practices as a result we’ve implemented a number of initiatives to ensure the long-term viability of the organization. 
 
From an organization-wide financial perspective, Lutherwood is implementing comprehensive cash management practices that ensure we conserve liquidity over the next 6 months. We’re exploring eligibility criteria for all COVID-19 government support opportunities and will apply for emergency relief wherever possible. Our Lutherwood Child and Family Foundation has been working hard on a special COVID-19 Spring Appeal which features a success story that has come out of Safe Haven. Proceeds from this appeal will support both Safe Haven and our children's mental health services.
 
Our annual Steps for Kids fundraiser traditionally brings in approximately 15% of our annual fundraised revenue. The loss of this physical event is quite substantial, the Foundation team is holding a virtual event instead in order to shore up some of the financial losses 
 
Lutherwood operates on a lean basis and is constantly ensuring that costs and revenues balance as much as possible. We always ensuring staffing levels match workload and funding (although most workload is up as most of our work is an essential service to vulnerable populations). We are moving staff from areas in the organization where client levels have dropped to areas in higher demand and are trying to hold onto as many staff as possible as we know we will need them when the pandemic hits our organization. Also, we are offering short-term leaves. However, due to service and business realities in some areas, we may temporarily lay off some staff in non-essential services who will be recalled when needed.
 
We’ve learned the value of diversifying our funding base and ensuring all our funders and donors like KW Community Foundation know what we are doing with their money and how successful the results have been (or lessons learned when things did not go according to plan). We’re working with primary funders to ensure continued funding for operations (many of our services are considered essential so we’re being assured that we will continue to receive base funding in most areas for the time being). We’ve also been briefing major donors and friends of Lutherwood to make them aware of our needs and we are asking them for help.
 
At Safe Haven specifically, we’re continuing to work closely with the Food Bank of Waterloo Region, which is the primary source of the food for our youth at this location. However, we’re aware of the significant increase in demand from the community on this resource and as such are working to find other resources to ensure food for our youth. We are working closely with the Shelter System and other agencies within the Region of Waterloo to coordinate services and ensure the needs of our youth are met.
","We have predicted that we will see expenses of approximately $24,500 for staffing, PPE, cleaning supplies and food.  If we cannot count on the food banks support to the same extent or if we need to increase usage of PPE this amount will increase.  "
