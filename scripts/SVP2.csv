We listen, facilitate healing, and celebrate resiliency. Using an intersectional feminist approach, we work to transform systems which promote gender-based violence. Vision: A world without sexual violence and oppression. ","We’re there when someone has experienced the darkest time in their life.
In the post-#MeToo era, we’ve been flooded with calls for support. 
Jian Ghomeshi. Bill Cosby. Harvey Weinstein. Sexual violence in the armed forces. In the RCMP. On college campuses. Concerns over police responses to sexual assaults. Headline after headline. And with each, more survivors reached out. 
We’re on the frontlines of this cultural shift locally. Five years ago, 40 survivors on our waiting list for counselling would have been a crisis; now we have 140. It’s our new normal.
As a Sexual Assault Support Centre, we wrap survivors in community care. We walk beside them on their journey. Our support is free and doesn’t come with time limits. For thirty years our motto’s been “You are NOT alone.” In the post-#MeToo era, we need your help to say this with confidence to survivors. 
We have a 24-Hour Support Line. We provide individual and group counselling. We accompany survivors to the police station, hospital, and court house. We offer practical supports. We also believe that public education can create social change and prevent violence in the future.
SVP is a philanthropic organization, but does so much more than providing funding. Members invest time and professional expertise in local non-profits, and seek to effect significant, long-term social change in our community. This is exactly what we’re trying to do as well.
We believe that if there ever was a time to invest in supports for survivors of sexual assault, and prevention work, it’s now… and especially in our community. Waterloo Region is currently in the midst of one of the largest sexual assault investigations in Canadian history – one neurologist has been charged with assaulting 63 women, and the investigation is still underway. 
","I believe trusted colleagues would describe me as passionate, authentic, collaborative, approachable, driven, and hard-working. Overall, I believe most folks who work with me trust my judgement, and believe in my ability and desire to make decisions in the best interests of our Centre and those we serve.

I strive to be an ambassador for SASC in Waterloo Region. My personal values and our Centre’s values align. I’ve been at our Centre in various capacities since 2002, which is rare in our sector. 

The two things I’m most proud of? We’ve doubled in size since I took over the newly created Executive Director role in 2015, including rolling out an incredible and very busy Anti-Human Trafficking Program. I'm also proud to have colleagues who are kind, passionate, and compassionate, and who care about survivors and work as team to achieve good things for our community.
","Our Board cares about survivors of sexual violence, supports our ED and staff team. Our Board members have values that align with the Centre.
We work to have a range of expertise and diversity on our Board complement. 
Our Board operates with transparency whenever possible, and is focused on governance, not operations.
A recent example of their strategic thinking? They supported our Executive Director in shifting half her direct reports to other managers so she could focus on the BIG PICTURE, and have the time to necessary to help move SASC to the next level in our community.
","Our ED and Board work on shared goals continuously. They drafted our 2017-2020 Strategic Plan in partnership. They developed various policies together to ensure the care and wellness of our team including: Preventing Vicarious Trauma & Burn Out Policy, RRSP matching policy, etc.
They work in partnership annually to secure sponsorships and auction items for our gala.
They work to connect our ED with their networks to secure support for the Centre. 
We’re moving into another collaborative Strategic Planning process in 2020, and welcome SVP to be part of it!
",We’re not expecting any major leadership changes within this timeframe. We’d be delighted to work with SVP over the next three years!,"Our Board President is generally replaced by the Vice-President, who has been groomed for the position in the previous year. We also have strong Governance Policies, that lay out processes clearly, which help with transition. That said, we are good at board retention, so we have a number of experienced members. 
On the operational side, our Executive Director works to ensure various processes are in place to assist with transition and communication, such as clear organizational/filing systems for funding information, key contacts, cross-training on key roles/information at the management level, etc. 
We don’t have a formal succession plan in place for our ED currently at the Board level; this is on our Centre’s to-do list. 
","In the post-#MeToo era, capacity is the overwhelming issue we face.
In 2018, we were set to get a sizeable increase in provincial funding to help meet this demand. After the provincial election, this funding was clawed back, creating more crisis in our sector.
In 2019, we successfully applied for funding from the Federal Government to hire our first-ever Communications & Development Coordinator (for four years). This grant covers 60% of a staff position.  Because of these funds, we’ve started to grow our fundraising program.
Our program includes, amongst other things, peer-to-peer fundraising opportunities, our annual gala, and a plan to secure and nurture monthly donors. Five years ago, SASC had three monthly donors. \to attract donors who can support services for survivors with sizeable gifts. 
","Project 1: Capacity and community engagement
Sexual violence has always been pervasive, but it hasn’t always been named and addressed. Now that society has experienced a cultural shift, we need SVP’s help to take our Centre to the next level… because survivors need us to grow. We need to develop strategies to engage folks to understand that if they support survivors, they need to support their community-based Sexual Assault Support Centre. 
We’re also facing all the other pressures that not-for-profit organizations are in this climate. In 2018, we were set to get a significant boast in our provincial funding to help meet the demand, but this funding was withdrawn after the election.
Overall, we need support to grow our fundraising program, and diversify our revenue sources. We have some ideas (such as an online social enterprise) that need to be researched, and developed if worthwhile. 
Project 2: Strategic Planning
We’re just completing our 2017-2020 Strategic Plan, and will be moving forward with creating a new one in 2020. We’d love SVP’s support with this process. We wrote our last plan before #MeToo.
Project 3: Office space/capital campaign/new home
We just received the news that the not-for-profit building we’ve occupied for 25 years is being sold. Our low rent has allowed us to flow our resources into programming. Staying here will mean coming up with an additional $60,000+ annually. We need help with a strategy. Do we stay put? Move? Consider a capital campaign? 
","We measure impact differently across our programs. In our Counselling Program, we ask survivors to complete feedback surveys. We also have pre- and post-tests that are optional for our clients to measure change in how they’re doing. We also use quantitative data like number of clients, number of counselling sessions, and number of participants in workshops.
In our Public Education Programs, we ask program participants to complete feedback surveys to communicate how much they learned, and how their attitudes shifted based on the workshop.
When we develop new programs, like our Anti-Human Trafficking Program, and our Workplace Sexual Harassment Program, we engage with external evaluators to ensure objective evaluation of our program development and impact.
And, in our sector, we also measure impact by simply listening to our clients. Our client’s testimonials are SO POWERFUL.  
","Our team has unique expertise and our model of service is effective. We provide a safe place. We walk beside survivors. We bear witness. We advocate. We understand the complex systems impacting survivors’ lives; we help navigate. We use an intersectional approach, which means we respect how survivor’s unique social locations impact their experiences, how people respond to them, and what resources they have access to. We celebrate the resiliency of survivors. We facilitate healing. We offer hope. 
Our approach to Public Education is known across the country. We were the first to develop a Male Allies Program to engage men and boys to be part of the work to end gendered violence. We developed anti-sexual violence curriculum for the OHL. We created Anti-Human Trafficking Curriculum that’s been adopted by a number of school boards, including the Waterloo Regional District School Board. ","We’ve been pretty transparent about our challenges and opportunities throughout this application. We have an amazing team at Centre and a healthy work environment. We try hard to care for our team as they do the challenging work on the frontlines with survivors of sexual violence every day. Our biggest challenge is truly that the resources needed for this work haven’t increased despite the incredible growth in demand. 
Last year, many people in our community were surprised to hear that Waterloo Region was rated the least safe major urban Centre in Canada for women. That study, by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said that our community’s combined rates of sexual assault, criminal harassment, and domestic violence were amongst the highest in Canada. To hear our Executive Director speak to this issue, visit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qym7HaW6Sc  
","We believe that if there ever was a time to invest in our work and in survivors of sexual violence, it’s now. 
If we’re selected to be SVP’s 2020 Investee, we’ll throw ourselves into the partnership! We’re a not-for-profit, but we’re also driven to succeed, to innovate, to grow, and to learn. Our inspiration comes from the incredible survivors we walk through our doors every day, and all the ones who sit on our waiting list. Let’s wrap them in community care.
